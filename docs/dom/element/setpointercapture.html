<h1>element.setPointerCapture</h1> <p><em>Pointer capture</em> allows events for a particular <em>pointer event</em> (<a title="The PointerEvent interface represents the state of a DOM event produced by a pointer such as the geometry of the contact point, the device type that generated the event, the amount of pressure that was applied on the contact surface, etc." href="../pointerevent"><code>PointerEvent</code></a>) to be re-targeted to a particular element instead of the normal target (or <em>hit test</em>) at a pointer's location. This can be used to ensure that an element continues to receive pointer events even if the pointer device's contact moves off the element (for example by scrolling).</p> <p><strong><code>setPointerCapture()</code></strong> is the method of the <a title="The Element interface represents an object of a Document.
