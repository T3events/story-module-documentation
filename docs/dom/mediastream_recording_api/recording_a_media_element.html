<h1>MediaStream Recording API: Recording a media element</h1> <p>While the article Using the MediaStream Recording API demonstrates using the <a title="The MediaRecorder interface of the MediaStream Recording API provides functionality to easily record media. It is created by the invocation of the MediaRecorder() constructor." href="../mediarecorder"><code>MediaRecorder</code></a> interface to capture a <a title="The MediaStream interface represents a stream of media content. A stream consists of several tracks such as video or audio tracks.

If the user provides permission, then the returned Promise is resolved with the resulting MediaStream object. If the user denies permission, or media is not available, then the promise is rejected with PermissionDeniedError or NotFoundError respectively. Note that it is possible for the returned promise to neither resolve nor reject, as the user is not required to make a choice." href="../mediadevices/getusermedia"><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()</code></a>, you can also use an HTML media element (namely <a title="The HTML &lt;audio&gt; element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the &lt;source&gt; element; the browser will choose the most suitable one." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio"><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code></a> or <a title="Use the  HTML &lt;video&gt; element to embed video content in a document. The video element contains one or more video sources.

In this article, we'll look at an example that does just that.</p> <div id="Example"> <h2 id="HTML_content">HTML content</h2>  <p>Let's start by looking at the key bits of the HTML. There's a little more than this, but it's just informational rather than being part of the core operation of the app.</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;div class="left"&gt;
  &lt;div id="startButton" class="button"&gt;
    Start
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;video id="preview" width="160" height="120" autoplay muted&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>We present our main interface in two columns. On the left is a start button and a <a title="Use the  HTML &lt;video&gt; element to embed video content in a document. The video element contains one or more video sources. To specify a video source, use either the src attribute or the &lt;source&gt; element; the browser will choose the most suitable one." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> element which displays the video preview; this is the video the user's camera sees. Note that the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attr-autoplay">autoplay</a></code> attribute is used so that as soon as the stream starts to arrive from the camera, it immediately gets displayed, and the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attr-muted">muted</a></code> attribute is specified to ensure that the sound from the user's microphone isn't output to their speakers, causing an ugly feedback loop.</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;div class="right"&gt;
  &lt;div id="stopButton" class="button"&gt;
    Stop
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Recording&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;video id="recording" width="160" height="120" controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;a id="downloadButton" class="button"&gt;
    Download
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>On the right we see a stop button and the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element which will be used to play back the recorded video. Notice that the playback panel doesn't have autoplay set (so the playback doesn't start as soon as media arrives), and it has <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attr-controls">controls</a></code> set, which tells it to show the user controls to play, pause, and so forth.</p> <p>Below the playback element is a button for downloading the recorded video.</p>  <h2 id="JavaScript_content">JavaScript content</h2> <p>Now let's have a look at the JavaScript code; this is where the majority of the action happens, after all!</p> <h3 id="Setting_up_global_variables">Setting up global variables</h3> <p>We start by establishing some global variables we'll need.</p> <pre data-language="js">let preview = document.getElementById("preview");
let recording = document.getElementById("recording");
let startButton = document.getElementById("startButton");
let stopButton = document.getElementById("stopButton");
let downloadButton = document.getElementById("downloadButton");
let logElement = document.getElementById("log");

let recordingTimeMS = 5000;
</pre> <p>Most of these are references to elements we need to work with. The last, <code>recordingTimeMS</code>, is set to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds); this specifies the length of the videos we'll record.</p> <h3 id="Utility_functions">Utility functions</h3> <p>Next, we create some utility functions that will get used later.</p> <pre data-language="js">function log(msg) {
  logElement.innerHTML += msg + "\n";
}
</pre> <p>The <code>log()</code> function is used to otuput text strings to a <a title="The HTML &lt;div&gt; element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the generic container for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element (such as &lt;article&gt; or &lt;nav&gt;) is appropriate." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> so we can share information with the user. Not very pretty but it gets the job done for our purposes.</p> <pre data-language="js">function wait(delayInMS) {
  return new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, delayInMS));
}
</pre> <p>The <code>wait()</code> function returns a new <a title="The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"><code>Promise</code></a> which resolves once the specified number of milliseconds have elapsed. It works by using an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow function</a> which calls <a title="Calls a function or executes a code snippet after a specified delay." href="../windoworworkerglobalscope/settimeout"><code>window.setTimeout()</code></a>, specifying the promise's resolution handler as the timeout handler function. That lets us use promise syntax when using timeouts, which can be very handy when chaining promises, as we'll see later.</p> <h3 id="Starting_media_recording">Starting media recording</h3> <p>The <code>startRecording()</code> function handles starting the recording process:</p> <pre data-language="js">function startRecording(stream, lengthInMS) {
  let recorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
