<h1>PointerEvent</h1> <p>The <strong><code>PointerEvent</code></strong> interface represents the state of a DOM event produced by a pointer such as the geometry of the contact point, the device type that generated the event, the amount of pressure that was applied on the contact surface, etc.</p> <p>A <em>pointer</em> is a hardware agnostic representation of input devices (such as a mouse, pen or contact point on a touch-enable surface). The pointer can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on the contact surface such as a screen.</p> <p>A pointer's <em>hit test</em> is the process a browser uses to determine the target element for a pointer event. Typically, this is determined by considering the pointer's location and also the visual layout of elements in a document on screen media.</p> <h2 id="Constructors">Constructors</h2> <dl> <dt><a title="The PointerEvent() constructor creates a new synthetic and untrusted PointerEvent." href="pointerevent/pointerevent"><code>PointerEvent()</code></a></dt> <dd>Creates a synthetic and untrusted PointerEvent.</dd> </dl> <h2 id="Properties">Properties</h2> <p><em>This interface inherits properties from <a title="The MouseEvent interface represents events that occur due to the user interacting with a pointing device (such as a mouse). Common events using this interface include click, dblclick, mouseup, mousedown。" href="mouseevent"><code>MouseEvent</code></a> and <a title="The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth).
