<h1>MediaDevices.getUserMedia</h1> <p>The <code><strong>MediaDevices.getUserMedia()</strong></code> method prompts the user for permission to use one video and/or one audio input device such as a camera or screensharing and/or a microphone. If the user provides permission, then the returned <a title="The Promise interface represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known at its creation time. It allows you to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success or failure. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in the future." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Promise"><code>Promise</code></a> is resolved with the resulting <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebRTC/MediaStream_API#LocalMediaStream">MediaStream</a></code> object. If the user denies permission, or media is not available, then the promise is rejected with <code>PermissionDeniedError</code> or <code>NotFoundError</code> respectively. Note that it is possible for the returned promise to neither resolve nor reject, as the user is not required to make a choice.</p> <h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2> <pre class="syntaxbox">var <em>promise</em> = <em>navigator.mediaDevices</em>.getUserMedia(<em>constraints</em>);

});</pre> <h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3> <dl> <dt><code>constraints</code></dt> <dd> <p>Is a <a title="The MediaStreamConstraints dictionary is used when calling getUserMedia() to specify what kinds of tracks should be included in the returned MediaStream, and, optionally, to establish constraints for those tracks' settings." href="../mediastreamconstraints"><code>MediaStreamConstraints</code></a> object specifying the types of media to request, along with any requirements for each type.</p> <p>The constraints parameter is a <code>MediaStreamConstraints</code> object with two members: <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code>, describing the media types requested. Either or both must be specified. If the browser cannot find all media tracks with the specified types that meet the constraints given, then the returned promise is rejected with <code>NotFoundError</code>.</p> <p>The following requests both audio and video without any specific requirements:</p> <pre data-language="js">{ audio: true, video: true }</pre> <p>If <code>true</code> is specified for a media type, the resulting stream is <em>required</em> to have that type of track in it. If one cannot be included for any reason, the call to <code>getUserMedia()</code> will result in an error.</p> <p>While information about a user's cameras and microphones are inaccessible for privacy reasons, an application can request the camera and microphone capabilities it needs and wants, using additional constraints. The following expresses a preference for 1280x720 camera resolution:</p> <pre data-language="js">{
  audio: true,
  video: { width: 1280, height: 720 }
}</pre> <p id="successCallback">The browser will try to honor this, but may return other resolutions if an exact match is not available, or the user overrides it.</p> <p>To <em>require</em> a capability, use the keywords <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, or <code>exact</code> (a.k.a. <code>min == max</code>). The following demands a minimum resolution of 1280x720:</p> <pre data-language="js">{
  audio: true,
  video: {
    width: { min: 1280 },
    height: { min: 720 }
  }
}</pre> <p>If no camera exists with this resolution or higher, then the returned promise will be rejected with <code>NotFoundError</code>, and the user will not be prompted.</p> <p>The reason for the difference in behavior is that the keywords <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>exact</code> are inherently mandatory, whereas plain values and a keyword called <code>ideal</code> are not. Here's a fuller example:</p> <pre data-language="js">{
  audio: true,
  video: {
    width: { min: 1024, ideal: 1280, max: 1920 },
    height: { min: 776, ideal: 720, max: 1080 }
  }
}</pre> <p>An <code>ideal</code> value, when used, has gravity, which means that the browser will try to find the setting (and camera, if you have more than one), with the smallest <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dfn-fitness-distance">fitness distance</a> from the ideal values given.</p> <p>Plain values are inherently ideal, which means that the first of our resolution examples above could have been written like this:</p> <pre data-language="js">{
  audio: true,
  video: {
    width: { ideal: 1280 },
    height: { ideal: 720 }
  }
}</pre> <p>Not all constraints are numbers. For example, on mobile devices, the following will prefer the front camera (if one is available) over the rear one:</p> <pre data-language="js">{ audio: true, video: { facingMode: "user" } }</pre> <p>To <em>require</em> the rear camera, use:</p> <pre data-language="js">{ audio: true, video: { facingMode: { exact: "environment" } } }</pre> </dd> </dl> <h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3> <p>A <a title="The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations.
