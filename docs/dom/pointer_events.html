<h1>Pointer events</h1> <p>Most of today's web content assumes the user's pointing device will be a mouse. However, since many devices support other types of pointing input devices, such as pen/stylus and touch surfaces, extensions to the existing pointing device event models are needed and <em><a href="#term_pointer_event">pointer events</a></em> address that need.</p> <p>Pointer events are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device. They are designed to create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus or touch (such as one or more fingers). The <em><a href="#term_pointer">pointer</a></em> is a hardware-agnostic device that can target a specific set of screen coordinates. Having a single event model for pointers can simplify creating Web sites and applications and provide a good user experience regardless of the user's hardware. However, for scenarios when device-specific handling is desired, pointer events defines a <a title="Indicates the device type that caused the pointer event. The supported values are the following strings:" href="pointerevent/pointertype"><code>property</code></a> to inspect the device type which produced the event.</p> <p>The events needed to handle generic pointer input are analogous to <a title="The MouseEvent interface represents events that occur due to the user interacting with a pointing device (such as a mouse). Common events using this interface include click, dblclick, mouseup, mousedown." href="mouseevent"><code>mouse events</code></a> (<code>mousedown/pointerdown</code>, <code>mousemove/pointermove</code>, etc.). Consequently, pointer event types are intentionally similar to mouse event types. Additionally, a pointer event contains the usual properties present in mouse events (client coordinates, target element, button states, etc.) in addition to new properties for other forms of input: pressure, contact geometry, tilt, etc. In fact, the <a title="The PointerEvent interface represents the state of a DOM event produced by a pointer such as the geometry of the contact point, the device type that generated the event, the amount of pressure that was applied on the contact surface, etc." href="pointerevent"><code>PointerEvent</code></a> interface inherits all of the <a title="The MouseEvent interface represents events that occur due to the user interacting with a pointing device (such as a mouse).

Consequently, even if a browser supports pointer events, the browser must still process mouse events so content that assumes mouse-only input will work as is without direct modification. Ideally, a pointer enabled application does not need to explicitly handle mouse input. However, because the browser must process mouse events, there may be some compatibility issues that need to be handled. This section contains information about pointer event and mouse event interaction and the ramifications for application developers.</p> <p>The browser <em>may map generic pointer input to mouse events for compatibility with mouse-based content</em>. This mapping of events is called <em>compatibility mouse events</em>. Authors can prevent the production of certain compatibility mouse events by canceling the pointerdown event but note that:</p> <ul> <li>Mouse events can only be prevented when the pointer is down.</li> <li>Hovering pointers (e.g. a mouse with no buttons pressed) cannot have their mouse events prevented.</li> <li>The mouseover, mouseout, mouseenter, and mouseleave events are never prevented (even if the pointer is down).</li> </ul> <h2 id="Best_practices">Best practices</h2> <p>Here are some <em>best practices</em> to consider when using pointer events:</p> <ul> <li>Minimize the amount of work done that is done in the event handlers.</li> <li>Add the event handlers to a specific target element (rather than the entire document or nodes higher up in the document tree).</li> <li>The target element (node) should be large enough to accommodate the largest contact surface area (typically a finger touch). If the target area is too small, touching it could result in firing other events for adjacent elements.</li> </ul> <h2 id="Implementation_and_deployment_status">Implementation and deployment status</h2> <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvents#Browser_compatibility">pointer events browser compatibility data</a> indicates pointer event support among desktop and mobile browsers is relatively low, although additional implementations are in progress.</p> <p>Some new value have been proposed for the <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action"><code>css touch-action</code></a> property as part of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/">Pointer Events Level 2</a> specification but currently those new values have no implementation support.</p> <h2 id="Demos_and_examples">Demos and examples</h2> <ul> <li><a href="http://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/">Touch/pointer tests and demos (by Patrick H.
