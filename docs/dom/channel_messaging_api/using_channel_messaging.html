<h1>Channel Messaging API: Using channel messaging</h1> <p>The <a href="../channel_messaging_api">Channel Messaging API</a> allows two separate scripts running in different browsing contexts attached to the same document (e.g., two IFrames, or the main document and an IFrame, or two documents via a <a title="The SharedWorker interface represents a specific kind of worker that can be accessed from several browsing contexts, such as several windows, iframes or even workers. They implement an interface different than dedicated workers and have a different global scope, SharedWorkerGlobalScope." href="../sharedworker"><code>SharedWorker</code></a>) to communicate directly, passing messages between one another through two-way channels (or pipes) with a port at each end. In this article we'll explore the basics of using this technology.</p> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> This feature is available in <a href="../web_workers_api">Web Workers</a>.</div> <h2 id="Use_cases">Use cases</h2> <p>Channel messaging is mainly useful in cases where you've got a social site that embeds capabilities from other sites into its main interface via IFrames, such as games, address book, or an audio player with personalized music choices. When these act as standalone units, things are ok, but the difficulty comes when you want interaction between the main site and the IFrames, or the different IFrames. For example, what if you wanted to add a contact to the address book from the main site, add high scores from your game into your main profile, or add new background music choices from the audio player onto the game? Such things are not so easy using conventional web technology, because of the security models the web uses. You have to think about whether the origins trust one another, and how the messages are passed.</p> <p>Message channels on the other hand can provide a secure channel that a single data item can be sent down, from one browsing context to another, after which the channel is closed. The sending context asks the receiving context for the capability to send a single message. At the receiving end, this message is actioned as appropriate (for example as "add a contact", or "share high scores".)</p> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: For more information and ideas, the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#ports-as-the-basis-of-an-object-capability-model-on-the-web">Ports as the basis of an object-capability model on the Web</a> section of the spec is a useful read.</p> </div> <h2 id="Simple_examples">Simple examples</h2> <p>To get your started, we have published a couple of demos on Github. First up, check out our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/channel-messaging-basic-demo">channel messaging basic demo</a> (<a href="http://mdn.github.io/channel-messaging-basic-demo/">run it live too</a>), which shows a really simple single message transfer between a page and an embedded <a title="The HTML Inline Frame Element (&lt;iframe&gt;) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page. In HTML 4.01, a document may contain a head and a body or a head and a frame-set, but not both a body and a frame-set. However, an &lt;iframe&gt; can be used within a normal document body. Each browsing context has its own session history and active document. The browsing context that contains the embedded content is called the parent browsing context. The top-level browsing context (which has no parent) is typically the browser window." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>. The embedded IFrame then sends a confirmation message back. Second, have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/channel-messaging-multimessage">multimessaging demo</a> (<a href="http://mdn.github.io/channel-messaging-multimessage/">run this live</a>), which shows a slightly more complex setup that can send multiple messages between main page and IFrame.</p> <p>We'll be focusing on the latter example in this article. It looks like so:</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/10075/channel-messaging-demo.png" style="display: block; height: 744px; margin: 0px auto; width: 690px;" alt=""></p> <h2 id="Creating_the_channel">Creating the channel</h2> <p>In the main page of the demo, we have a paragraph and a simple form with a text input for entering messages to be sent to an <a title="The HTML Inline Frame Element (&lt;iframe&gt;) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page. In HTML 4.01, a document may contain a head and a body or a head and a frame-set, but not both a body and a frame-set. However, an &lt;iframe&gt; can be used within a normal document body. Each browsing context has its own session history and active document. The browsing context that contains the embedded content is called the parent browsing context. The top-level browsing context (which has no parent) is typically the browser window." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>.</p> <pre data-language="js">var para = document.querySelector('p');
var textInput = document.querySelector('.message-box');
var button = document.querySelector('button');
    
var ifr = document.querySelector('iframe');
var otherWindow = ifr.contentWindow;

ifr.addEventListener("load", iframeLoaded, false);
    
function iframeLoaded() {
  button.onclick = function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
        
    var channel = new MessageChannel();
    otherWindow.postMessage(textInput.value, '*', [channel.port2]);

    channel.port1.onmessage = handleMessage;
    function handleMessage(e) {
      para.innerHTML = e.data;
      textInput.value = '';
    }
  }
}</pre> <p>When the IFrame has loaded, we run an <code>iframeLoaded()</code> function containing an <code>onclick</code> handler for our button — when the button is clicked, we prevent the form submitting as normal, create a new message channel with the <a title="The MessageChannel interface of the Channel Messaging API allows us to create a new message channel and send data through it via its two MessagePort properties." href="../messagechannel"><code>MessageChannel.MessageChannel</code></a> constructor, then send the value entered in our text input to the IFrame via the <a title="The MessageChannel interface of the Channel Messaging API allows us to create a new message channel and send data through it via its two MessagePort properties." href="../messagechannel"><code>MessageChannel</code></a>. Let's explore how the <code>window.postMessage</code> line works in a bit more detail.</p> <p>For a start, here we are calling the <a title="The window.postMessage method safely enables cross-origin communication. Normally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages that executed them are at locations with the same protocol (usually both https), port number (443 being the default for https), and host (modulo document.domain being set by both pages to the same value). window.postMessage provides a controlled mechanism to circumvent this restriction in a way which is secure when properly used." href="../window/postmessage"><code>window.postMessage</code></a> method — we are posting a message to the IFrame's window context. <a title="The window.postMessage method safely enables cross-origin communication. Normally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages that executed them are at locations with the same protocol (usually both https), port number (443 being the default for https), and host (modulo document.domain being set by both pages to the same value). window.postMessage provides a controlled mechanism to circumvent this restriction in a way which is secure when properly used." href="../window/postmessage"><code>window.postMessage</code></a> has three arguments, unlike <a title="The postMessage() method of the MessagePort interface sends a message from the port, and optionally, transfers ownership of objects to other browsing contexts." href="../messageport/postmessage"><code>MessagePort.postmessage</code></a>, which only has two. The three arguments are:</p> <ol> <li>The message being sent, in this case <code>textInput.value</code>.</li> <li>The origin the message is to be sent to. * means "any origin".</li> <li>An object, the ownership of which is transferred to the receiving browsing context. In this case, we are transferring <a title="The port2 read-only property of the MessageChannel interface returns second port of the message channel, the port attached to the context at the other end of the channel, which the message is initially sent to." href="../messagechannel/port2"><code>MessageChannel.port2</code></a> to the IFrame, so it can be used to receive the message from the main page.</li> </ol> <p>At the bottom of the <code>iframeLoaded()</code> function there is a <a title="The onmessage event handler of the MessagePort interface is an EventListener, called whenever an MessageEvent of type message is fired on the port — that is, when the port receives a message." href="../messageport/onmessage"><code>MessagePort.onmessage</code></a> handler, but we'll get to that later.</p> <h2 id="Receiving_the_port_and_message_in_the_IFrame">Receiving the port and message in the IFrame</h2> <p>Over in the IFrame, we have the following JavaScript:</p> <pre data-language="js">var list = document.querySelector('ul');

onmessage = function(e) {
  var listItem = document.createElement('li');
  listItem.textContent = e.data;
  list.appendChild(listItem);
  e.ports[0].postMessage('Message received by IFrame: "' + e.data + '"');
}</pre> <p>The entirety of the code is wrapped in a <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/onmessage"><code>window.onmessage</code></a> handler, which runs when the message is received from the main page (via its <code>postMessage()</code>.) First we create a list item and insert it in the unordered list, setting the <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextContent"><code>Node.textContent</code></a> of the list item equal to the event's <code>data</code> attribute (this contains the actual message).</p> <p>Next, we post a confirmation message back to the main page via the message channel, using <code>e.ports[0].postMessage()</code>. How does this work? Earlier we transferred <code>port2</code> over to the IFrame — this is accessible in the event's <code>ports</code> attribute (array position <code>[0]</code>). We call <a title="The postMessage() method of the MessagePort interface sends a message from the port, and optionally, transfers ownership of objects to other browsing contexts." href="../messageport/postmessage"><code>MessagePort.postMessage</code></a> on this port — since <code>port2</code> is being controlled by the IFrame, and it is joined to port1 by the message channel, the specified message will be sent back to the main page.</p> <h2 id="Receiving_the_confirmation_in_the_main_page">Receiving the confirmation in the main page</h2> <p>Returning to the main page, let's now look at the onmessage handler at the bottom of the <code>iframeLoaded()</code> function:</p> <pre data-language="js">channel.port1.onmessage = handleMessage;
function handleMessage(e) {
  para.innerHTML = e.data;
  textInput.value = '';
}</pre> <p>Here we are setting <code>port1</code>'s <a title="The onmessage event handler of the MessagePort interface is an EventListener, called whenever an MessageEvent of type message is fired on the port — that is, when the port receives a message." href="../messageport/onmessage"><code>MessagePort.onmessage</code></a> handler equal to the <code>handleMessage()</code> function — when a message is received back from the IFrame confirming that the original message was received successfully, this simply outputs the confirmation to a paragraph and empties the text input ready for the next message to be sent.</p> <h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2> <table class="standard-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="col">Specification</th> <th scope="col">Status</th> <th scope="col">Comment</th> </tr> <tr> <td><a title="The 'WHATWG HTML Living Standard' specification" hreflang="en" class="external" lang="en" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#toc-comms">WHATWG HTML Living Standard</a></td> <td><span class="spec-Living">Living Standard</span></td> <td>No difference to the HTML5 Web Messaging spec.
