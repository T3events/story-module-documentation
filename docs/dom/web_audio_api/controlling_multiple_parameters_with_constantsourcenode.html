The default value is 1.0, and its nominal range is -∞ to +∞." href="../constantsourcenode/offset"><code>ConstantSourceNode.offset</code></a> parameter.</span></p> <p>You may have times when you want to have multiple audio parameters be linked so they share the same value even while being changed in some way. For example, perhaps you have a set of oscillators, and two of them need to share the same, configurable volume, or you have a filter that's been applied to certain inputs but not to all of them. You could use a loop and change the value of each affected <a title="There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:" href="../audioparam"><code>AudioParam</code></a> one at a time, but there are two drawbacks to doing it that way: first, that's extra code that, as you're about to see, you don't have to write; and second, that loop uses valuable CPU time on your thread (likely the main thread), and there's a way to offload all that work to the audio rendering thread, which is optimized for this kind of work and may run at a more appropriate priority level than your code.</p> <p>The solution is simple, and it involves using an audio node type which, at first glance, doesn't look all that useful: <a title="The ConstantSourceNode interface—part of the Web Audio API—represents an audio source (based upon AudioScheduledSourceNode) whose output is single unchanging value. This makes it useful for cases in which you need a constant value coming in from an audio source. in addition, it can be used like a constructible AudioParam by automating the value of its offset or by connecting another node to it; see Controlling multiple parameters with ConstantSourceNode." href="../constantsourcenode"><code>ConstantSourceNode</code></a>.</p> <h2 id="The_technique">The technique</h2> <p>This is actually a really easy way to do something that sounds like it might be hard to do. You simply need to create a <a title="The ConstantSourceNode interface—part of the Web Audio API—represents an audio source (based upon AudioScheduledSourceNode) whose output is single unchanging value. This makes it useful for cases in which you need a constant value coming in from an audio source. in addition, it can be used like a constructible AudioParam by automating the value of its offset or by connecting another node to it; see Controlling multiple parameters with ConstantSourceNode." href="../constantsourcenode"><code>ConstantSourceNode</code></a> and connect it to all of the <a title="There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:" href="../audioparam"><code>AudioParam</code></a>s whose values should be linked to always match each other. Since <code>ConstantSourceNode</code>'s <a title="An AudioParam object indicating the a-rate value returned for every sample by this node. The default value is 1.0, and its nominal range is -∞ to +∞." href="../constantsourcenode/offset"><code>offset</code></a> value is simply sent straight through to all of its outputs, it acts as a splitter for that value, sending it to each connected parameter.</p> <p>The diagram below shows how this works; an input value, <code>N</code>, is set as the value of the <a title="An AudioParam object indicating the a-rate value returned for every sample by this node. The default value is 1.0, and its nominal range is -∞ to +∞." href="../constantsourcenode/offset"><code>ConstantSourceNode.offset</code></a> property. The <code>ConstantSourceNode</code> can have as many outputs as necessary; in this case, we've connected it to three nodes: two <a title="The gain is a unitless value, changing with time, that is multiplied to each corresponding sample of all input channels. If modified, the new gain is applied using a de-zippering algorithm in order to prevent unaesthetic 'clicks' from appearing in the resulting audio." href="../gainnode"><code>GainNode</code></a>s and a <a title="The pan property takes a unitless value between -1 (full left pan) and 1 (full right pan). This interface was introduced as a much simpler way to apply a simple panning effect than having to use a full PannerNode." href="../stereopannernode"><code>StereoPannerNode</code></a>. So <code>N</code> becomes the value of the specified parameter (<a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gain"><code>gain</code></a> for the <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="#"><code><code>GainNode</code></code></a>s and pan for the <a title="The pan property takes a unitless value between -1 (full left pan) and 1 (full right pan).

In this simple example, we create three <a title="The OscillatorNode interface represents a periodic waveform, such as a sine wave.

Two of them have adjustable gain, controlled using a shared input control. The other oscillator has a fixed volume.</p> <h3 id="HTML">HTML</h3> <p>The HTML content for this example is primarily a button to toggle the oscillator tones on and off and an <a title="The HTML &lt;input&gt; element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.

&lt;p&gt;Use the button above to start and stop the tones, and the volume control to

</pre> <p>First, we get access to the window's <a title="An AudioContext can be a target of events, therefore it implements the EventTarget interface." href="../audiocontext"><code>AudioContext</code></a>, stashing the reference in <code>context</code>. Then we get references to the control widgets, setting <code>playButton</code> to reference the play button and <code>volumeControl</code> to reference the slider control that the user will use to adjust the gain on the linked pair of oscillators.</p> <p>Then we assign a handler for the play button's <code><a title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click">click</a></code> event (see <a href="#Toggling_the_oscillators_on_and_off">Toggling the oscillators on and off</a> for more on the <code>togglePlay()</code> method), and for the volume slider's <code><a title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input">input</a></code> event (see <a href="#Controlling_the_linked_oscillators">Controlling the linked oscillators</a> to see the very short <code>changeVolume()</code> method).</p> <p>Next, the <a title="The gain is a unitless value, changing with time, that is multiplied to each corresponding sample of all input channels.

Let's look at the code.</p> <pre data-language="js">function togglePlay(event) {

}</pre> <p>If the <code>playing</code> variable indicates we're already playing the oscillators, we change the <code>playButton</code>'s content to be the Unicode character "right-pointing triangle" (▶️) and call <code>stopOscillators()</code> to shut down the oscillators. See <a href="#Stopping_the_oscillators">Stopping the oscillators</a> below for that code.</p> <p>If <code>playing</code> is false, indicating that we're currently paused, we change the play button's content to be the Unicode character "pause symbol" (⏸) and call <code>startOscillators()</code> to start the oscillators playing their tones. That code is covered under <a href="#Starting_the_oscillators">Starting the oscillators</a> below.</p> <h4 id="Controlling_the_linked_oscillators">Controlling the linked oscillators</h4> <p>The <code>changeVolume()</code> function—the event handler for the slider control for the gain on the linked oscillator pair—looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="js">function changeVolume(event) {

Being able to shorten the number of operations to adjust them all will prove invaluable for code size and performance both.</p> <h4 id="Starting_the_oscillators">Starting the oscillators</h4> <p>When the user clicks the play/pause toggle button while the oscillators aren't playing, the <code>startOscillators()</code> function gets called.</p> <pre data-language="js">function startOscillators() {
