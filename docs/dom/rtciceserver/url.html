It includes both the URL and the necessary credentials, if any, to connect to the server." href="../rtciceserver"><code>RTCIceServer</code></a> dictionary's <strong><code>url</code></strong> property specifies the URL of a single ICE server to be used while negotiating connections. It was removed from the specification in June 2013 but is still broadly used in older examples and books, so we include documentation here to help adapt old code to new browsers.</p> <p>This property has been removed from the specification; while it's still supported by many browsers, it should no longer be used. You should instead use the newer <a title="The RTCIceServer dictionary's urls property specifies the URL or URLs of the servers to be used for ICE negotiations. These are typically STUN and/or TURN servers." href="urls"><code>urls</code></a> property, which allows you to optionally specify multiple URLs for the server.
