  iceServers: [
    {
      urls: "stun:stunserver.example.org"
    }
  ]
});</pre> <p>Notice that only the <code>urls</code> property is provided; the STUN server doesn't require authentication, so this is all that's needed.</p> <h3 id="A_single_ICE_server_with_authentication">A single ICE server with authentication</h3> <p>The second example creates a new <a title="The RTCPeerConnection interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed." href="../rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> which will use a <a title="TURN: TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) is a protocol enabling a computer to receive and send data from behind a Network Address Translator (NAT) or firewall." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TURN" class="glossaryLink">TURN</a> server at <code>turnserver.example.org</code> to negotiate connections.

This is useful if the server is, for example, available both on "turn" and "turns" schemes, or if there's a fallback address available for the server.</p> <div class="note"> <p>Keep in mind that ICE will try all the URLs you list here, so the more you include, the longer connections will take to establish.</p> </div> <pre data-language="js">myPeerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({
