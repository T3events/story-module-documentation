<h1>WebRTC API: Using DTMF</h1><div class="overheadIndicator draft"> <p><strong>Draft</strong><br> This page is not complete.</p> </div> <p><span class="seoSummary">In order to more fully support audio/video conferencing, <a href="../webrtc_api">WebRTC</a> supports sending <a title='DTMF: Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signaling is a system by which audible tones are used to represent buttons being pressed on a keypad. Frequently referred to in the United States as "touch tone" (after the Touch-Tone trademark used when the transition from pulse dialing to DTMF began), DTMF makes it possible to signal the digits 0-9 as well as the letters "A" through "D" and the symbols "#" and "*". Few telephone keypads include the letters, which are typically used for control signaling by the telephone network.' href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DTMF" class="glossaryLink">DTMF</a> to the remote peer on an <a title="The RTCPeerConnection interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed." href="../rtcpeerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a>. This article offers a brief high-level overview of how DTMF works over WebRTC, then provides a guide for everyday developers about how to send DTMF over an <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. The DTMF system is often referred to as "touch tone," after an old trade name for the system.</span></p> <p>Web RTC doesn't send DTMF codes as audio data. Instead, they're sent out-of-band, as RTP payloads. While it's possible to send DTMF using WebRTC, there is currently no way to detect incoming DTMF. WebRTC currently ignores these payloads. DTMF support is primarily intended for use with legacy telephone services that rely on DTMF tones, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Teleconferencing systems</li> <li>Menu systems</li> <li>Voicemail systems</li> <li>Entry of credit card or other payment information</li> <li>Passcode entry</li> </ul> <div class="note"> <p>While the DTMF is not sent to the remote peer as audio, browsers may choose to play the corresponding tone to the local user as part of their user experience, since users are typically used to hearing their phone play the tones audibly.</p> </div> <p>If you're curious how this works, you can learn more in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/3550">RFC 3550: RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/4733">RFC 4733: RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals</a>. The details of how DTMF payloads are handled on RTP are beyond the scope of this article.</p><div class="_attribution">
