<h1>Performance API</h1> <p>The <strong>High Resolution Time</strong> standard defines a <a href="performance" title="The Performance interface represents timing-related performance information for the given page."><code>Performance</code></a> interface that supports client-side latency measurements within applications. The <a href="performance" title="The Performance interface represents timing-related performance information for the given page."><code>Performance</code></a> interfaces are considered <em>high resolution</em> because they are accurate to a thousandth of a millisecond (subject to hardware or software constraints). The interfaces support a number of use cases including calculating frame-rates (potentially important in animations) and benchmarking (such as the time to load a resource).</p> <p>Since a platform's <em>system clock</em> is subject to various <em>skews</em> (such as NTP adjustments), the interfaces support a <em>monotonic clock</em> i.e. a clock that is always increasing. As such, the <code>Performance</code> API defines a <a href="domhighrestimestamp" title="The DOMHighResTimeStamp type is a double and is used to store a time value. The value could be a discrete point in time or the difference in time between two discrete points in time. The unit is milliseconds and should be accurate to 5 µs (microseconds).
