<h1>Cache</h1><div class="notice experimental"> <p> <strong>This is an experimental technology</strong><br>Because this technology's specification has not stabilized, check the <a href="#Browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes.</p> </div> <p>The <strong><code>Cache</code></strong> interface provides a storage mechanism for <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request">Request</a></code> / <code><a href="http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response">Response</a></code> object pairs that are cached, for example as part of the <a title="The ServiceWorker interface of the ServiceWorker API provides a reference to a service worker. Multiple browsing contexts (e.g. pages, workers, etc.) can be associated with the same service worker, each through a unique ServiceWorker object." href="serviceworker"><code>ServiceWorker</code></a> life cycle. Note that the <code>Cache</code> interface is exposed to windowed scopes as well as workers. You don't have to use it in conjunction with service workers, even though it is defined in the service worker spec.</p> <p>An origin can have multiple, named <code>Cache</code> objects. You are responsible for implementing how your script (e.g. in a <a title="The ServiceWorker interface of the ServiceWorker API provides a reference to a service worker. Multiple browsing contexts (e.g. pages, workers, etc.) can be associated with the same service worker, each through a unique ServiceWorker object." href="serviceworker"><code>ServiceWorker</code></a>) handles <code>Cache</code> updates. Items in a <code>Cache</code> do not get updated unless explicitly requested; they don’t expire unless deleted. Use <a title="The open() method of the CacheStorage interface returns a Promise that resolves to the Cache object matching the cacheName." href="cachestorage/open"><code>CacheStorage.open(cacheName)</code></a> to open a specific named <code>Cache</code> object and then call any of the <code>Cache</code> methods to maintain the <code>Cache</code>.</p> <p>You are also responsible for periodically purging cache entries. Each browser has a hard limit on the amount of cache storage that a given origin can use. The browser does its best to manage disk space, but it may delete the Cache storage for an origin. The browser will generally delete all of the data for an origin or none of the data for an origin. Make sure to version caches by name and use the caches only from the version of the script that they can safely operate on.

If no match is found, the Promise resolves to undefined." href="cache/match"><code>Cache.match(request, options)</code></a> to see if there's already a matching font in the cache, and if so, returns it. If there isn't a matching font, the code fetches the font from the network and uses <a title="The put() method of the Cache interface allows key/value pairs to be added to the current Cache object." href="cache/put"><code>Cache.put(request, response)</code></a> to cache the fetched resource.</p> <p>The code handles exceptions thrown from the <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> operation. Note that a HTTP error response (e.g., 404) will not trigger an exception. It will return a normal response object that has the appropriate error code set.</p> <p>The code snippet also shows a best practice for versioning caches used by the service worker. Though there's only one cache in this example, the same approach can be used for multiple caches. It maps a shorthand identifier for a cache to a specific, versioned cache name. The code also deletes all caches that aren't named in <code>CURRENT_CACHES</code>.</p> <p>In the code example, "caches" is an attribute of the service workers WorkerGlobalScope. It holds the CacheStorage object, which by we can access the <a href="cachestorage">CacheStorage</a> API.</p> <div class="note">
