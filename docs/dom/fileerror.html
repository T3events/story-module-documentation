It extends the <code>FileError</code> interface described in <a class="external" href="http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/pub/FileSystem/#bib-FILE-WRITER">File Writer</a> and adds several new error codes.</p> <p><code>FileError</code> objects are passed to error callbacks. The objects have a code that shows the type of error that occurred.</p> <h2 id="Best_practices">Best practices</h2> <p>Most people don't read the page on errors and exceptions unless they're stumped. So the following are a few tips that could help you avoid some pitfalls.</p> <h3 id="Error_callbacks_are_not_optional_for_your_sanity">Error callbacks are not optional for your sanity</h3> <p>Although error callbacks are optional, you should include them in the arguments of the methods for the sake of the sanity of your users. A web app could fail for various reasons, so you don't want to spend the rest of your day guessing what's going on and going through maddening troubleshooting.</p> <h3 id="Don't_run_your_app_from_file">Don't run your app from file://</h3> <p>For security reasons, browsers do not allow you to run your app from <code>file://</code>. In fact, many of the powerful storage APIs (such as File System, BlobBuilder, and FileReader) throw errors if you run the app locally from <code>file://</code>. When you're just testing your app, and you don't want to set up a web server, you can bypass the security restriction on Chrome. Just start Chrome with the <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code> flag. Use the flag only for testing purposes.</p> <h2 id="Attribute">Attribute</h2> <table class="standard-table"> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col">Attribute</th> <th scope="col">Type</th> <th scope="col">Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><a><code>code</code></a></td> <td><code>unsigned short</code></td> <td>The most appropriate error code for the condition.
