<h1>window.postMessage</h1> <p>The <code><strong>W</strong></code><strong><code>indow.postMessage()</code></strong> method safely enables cross-origin communication. Normally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages that executed them are at locations with the same protocol (usually both <code>https</code>), port number (<code>443</code> being the default for <code>https</code>), and host (modulo <a href="../document/domain" title="Gets/sets the domain portion of the origin of the current document, as used by the same origin policy."><code>Document.domain</code></a> being set by both pages to the same value). <code>window.postMessage()</code> provides a controlled mechanism to circumvent this restriction in a way which is secure when properly used.</p> <p>The <code>window.postMessage()</code> method, when called, causes a <a href="../messageevent" title="A MessageEvent is the interface representing a message received by a target, being a WebSocket or a WebRTC RTCDataChannel"><code>MessageEvent</code></a> to be dispatched at the target window when any pending script that must be executed completes (e.g., remaining event handlers if <code>window.postMessage()</code> is called from an event handler, previously-set pending timeouts, etc.) The <a href="../messageevent" title="A MessageEvent is the interface representing a message received by a target, being a WebSocket or a WebRTC RTCDataChannel"><code>MessageEvent</code></a> has the type <code>message</code>, a <code>data</code> property which is set to the value of the first argument provided to <code>window.postMessage()</code>, an <code>origin</code> property corresponding to the origin of the main document in the window calling <code>window.postMessage</code> at the time <code>window.postMessage()</code> was called, and a <code>source</code> property which is the window from which <code>window.postMessage()</code> is called. (Other standard properties of events are present with their expected values.)</p> <h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2> <pre class="syntaxbox"><em>otherWindow</em>.postMessage(<em>message</em>, <em>targetOrigin</em>, [<em>transfer</em>]);</pre> <dl> <dt><code><em>otherWindow</em></code></dt> <dd>A reference to another window; such a reference may be obtained, for example, using the <code>contentWindow</code> property of an <code>iframe</code> element, the object returned by <a href="open">window.open</a>, or by named or numeric index on <a href="frames" title="Returns the window itself, which is an array-like object, listing the direct sub-frames of the current window."><code>Window.frames</code></a>.</dd> <dt><code><em>message</em></code></dt> <dd>Data to be sent to the other window. <code>The data</code> is serialized using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/The_structured_clone_algorithm">the structured clone algorithm</a>.

If at the time the event is scheduled to be dispatched the scheme, hostname, or port of <code>otherWindow</code>'s document does not match that provided in <code>targetOrigin</code>, the event will not be dispatched; only if all three match will the event be dispatched. This mechanism provides control over where messages are sent; for example, if <code>postMessage()</code> was used to transmit a password, it would be absolutely critical that this argument be a URI whose origin is the same as the intended receiver of the message containing the password, to prevent interception of the password by a malicious third party. <strong>Always provide a specific <code>targetOrigin</code>, not <code>*</code>, if you know where the other window's document should be located.

</pre> <h3 id="Notes">Notes</h3> <p>Any window may access this method on any other window, at any time, regardless of the location of the document in the window, to send it a message. Consequently, any event listener used to receive messages <strong>must</strong> first check the identity of the sender of the message, using the <code>origin</code> and possibly <code>source</code> properties. This cannot be overstated: <strong>Failure to check the <code>origin</code> and possibly <code>source</code> properties enables cross-site scripting attacks.</strong></p> <p>As with any asynchronously-dispatched script (timeouts, user-generated events), it is not possible for the caller of <code>postMessage</code> to detect when an event handler listening for events sent by <code>postMessage</code> throws an exception.</p> <p>The value of the <code>origin</code> property of the dispatched event is not affected by the current value of <code>document.domain</code> in the calling window.</p> <p>For IDN host names only, the value of the <code>origin</code> property is not consistently Unicode or punycode; for greatest compatibility check for both the IDN and punycode values when using this property if you expect messages from IDN sites. This value will eventually be consistently IDN, but for now you should handle both IDN and punycode forms.</p> <p>The value of the <code>origin</code> property when the sending window contains a <code>javascript:</code> or <code>data:</code> URL is the origin of the script that loaded the URL.</p> <h3 id="Using_window.postMessage_in_extensions">Using window.postMessage in extensions 
</h3> <p><code>window.postMessage</code> is available to JavaScript running in chrome code (e.g., in extensions and privileged code), but the <code>source</code> property of the dispatched event is always <code>null</code> as a security restriction. (The other properties have their expected values.) The <code>targetOrigin</code> argument for a message sent to a window located at a <code>chrome:</code> URL is currently misinterpreted such that the only value which will result in a message being sent is <code>"*"</code>. Since this value is unsafe when the target window can be navigated elsewhere by a malicious site, it is recommended that <code>postMessage</code> not be used to communicate with <code>chrome:</code> pages for now; use a different method (such as a query string when the window is opened) to communicate with chrome windows. Lastly, posting a message to a page at a <code>file:</code> URL currently requires that the <code>targetOrigin</code> argument be <code>"*"</code>. <code>file://</code> cannot be used as a security restriction; this restriction may be modified in the future.</p> <h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2> <table class="standard-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th><strong>Specification</strong></th> <th><strong>Status</strong></th> <th><strong>Comment</strong></th> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#dom-window-postmessage" class="external" lang="en" hreflang="en">WHATWG HTML Living Standard<br><small lang="en-US">The definition of 'window.postMessage' in that specification.</small></a></td> <td><span class="spec-Living">Living Standard</span></td> <td>No change from <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webmessaging/" class="external" lang="en" title="The 'HTML5 Web Messaging' specification" hreflang="en">HTML5 Web Messaging</a>
