<h1>window.window</h1>  <p>The <code>window</code> property of a window object points to the window object itself. Thus the following expressions all return the same window object:</p> <pre class="syntaxbox">window.window
window.window.window
window.window.window.window
  ...
</pre> <p>In web pages, the window object is also a <em>global object</em>. This means that:</p> <ol> <li>global variables of your script are in fact properties of <code>window</code>: <pre data-language="js">var global = {data: 0};
alert(global === window.global); // displays "true"
</pre> </li> <li>you can access built-in properties of the window object without having to type <code>window.</code> prefix: <pre data-language="js">setTimeout("alert('Hi!')", 50); // equivalent to using window.setTimeout.
alert(window === window.window); // displays "true"
</pre> </li> </ol> <p>The point of having the <code>window</code> property refer to the object itself was (probably) to make it easy to refer to the global object (otherwise you'd have to do a manual <code>var window = this;</code> assignment at the top of your script).</p> <p>Another reason is that without this property you wouldn't be able to write, for example, "<a href="open" title="Loads a resource into either a new browsing context (such as a window) or one that already exists, depending on the specified parameters."><code>window.open('http://google.com/')</code></a>" - you'd have to just use "open('http://google.com/')" instead.</p> <p>Yet another reason to use this property is for libraries which wish to offer OOP-versions and non-OOP versions (especially JavaScript modules). If, for example, we refer to "this.window.location.href", a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules">JavaScript module</a> could define a property called "window" inside of a class it defined (since no global "window" variable exists for it by default) which, could be created, for example, after passing in a window object to the module class' constructor. Thus, "this.window" inside of its functions would refer to that window object. In the non-namespaced version, "this.window" would simply refer back to "window", and also be able to get the document location without trouble. Another advantage is that the objects of such a class (even if the class were defined outside of a module) could change their reference to the window at will, as they would not be able to do if they had hard-coded a reference to "window" (yet the default in the class could still be set as the current window object).</p> <h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2> <table class="standard-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="col">Specification</th> <th scope="col">Status</th> <th scope="col">Comment</th> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#dom-window" class="external" lang="en" hreflang="en">WHATWG HTML Living Standard<br><small lang="en-US">The definition of 'Window.window' in that specification.</small></a></td> <td><span class="spec-Living">Living Standard</span></td> <td>No difference from the latest snapshot <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/" class="external" lang="en" title="The 'HTML5.1' specification" hreflang="en">HTML5.1</a>
