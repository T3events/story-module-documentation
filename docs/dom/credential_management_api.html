 <p class="summary">The Credential Management API lets a website store and retrieve both user and federated credentials. These capabilities allow users to sign in without typing passwords, see the federated account they used to sign in to a site, and resume a session without the explicit sign-in flow of an expired session.</p> </div> <h2 id="Credential_management_concepts_and_usage">Credential management concepts and usage</h2> <p>This API lets websites interact with a user agent’s password system so that websites can deal in a uniform way with site credentials and user agents can provide better assistance with the management of their credentials. For example, user agents have a particularly hard time dealing with federated identity providers or esoteric sign-in mechanisms that use more than just a username and password. To address these problems, the Credential Management API provides ways for a website to store and retrieve different types of password credentials. This give users capabilities such as seeing the federated account they used to sign on to a site, or resuming a session without the explicit sign-in flow of an expired session.</p> <div class="note"> <p>This API is restricted to top-level contexts.
