<h1>TouchEvent</h1> <p>The <strong><code>TouchEvent</code></strong> interface represents an event sent when the state of contacts with a touch-sensitive surface changes. This surface can be a touch screen or trackpad, for example. The event can describe one or more points of contact with the screen and includes support for detecting movement, addition and removal of contact points, and so forth.</p> <p>Touches are represented by the <a title="The Touch interface represents a single contact point on a touch-sensitive device. The contact point is commonly a finger or stylus and the device may be a touchscreen or trackpad." href="touch"><code>Touch</code></a> object; each touch is described by a position, size and shape, amount of pressure, and target element. Lists of touches are represented by <a title="The TouchList interface represents a list of contact points with a touch surface; for example, if the user has three fingers on the touch surface (such as a screen or trackpad), the corresponding TouchList object would have one Touch object for each finger, for a total of three entries." href="touchlist"><code>TouchList</code></a> objects.</p> <h2 id="Constructor">Constructor</h2> <dl> <dt><a title="The TouchEvent() constructor creates a new TouchEvent." href="touchevent/touchevent"><code>TouchEvent()</code></a></dt> <dd>Creates a <code>TouchEvent</code> object.</dd> </dl> <h2 id="Properties">Properties</h2> <p><em>This interface inherits properties from its parent, <a title="The UIEvent interface represents simple user interface events." href="uievent"><code>UIEvent</code></a> and <a title="The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth).
