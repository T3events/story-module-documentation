<h1>Worker</h1> <p>The <strong><code>Worker</code></strong> interface of the <a href="web_workers_api">Web Workers API</a> represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the <code>Worker()</code> constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread.</p> <p>Workers may in turn spawn new workers as long as those workers are hosted within the same <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">origin</a> as the parent page (Note: nested workers are <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/5R3B4RN4GHU">currently not implemented in Blink</a>). In addition workers may use <a href="xmlhttprequest" class="internal" title="En/XMLHttpRequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> for network I/O, with the stipulation that the <code>responseXML</code> and <code>channel</code> attributes on <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> always return <code>null</code>.</p> <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Worker/Functions_available_to_workers" title="En/DOM/Worker/Functions available to workers">Not all interfaces and functions are available</a> to the script associated with a <code>Worker</code>.</p> <p>In Firefox, if you want to use workers in extensions and would like to have access to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/js-ctypes" title="en/js-ctypes">js-ctypes</a>, you should use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChromeWorker" title="If you're developing privileged code, and would like to create a worker that can use js-ctypes to perform calls to native code, you can do so by using ChromeWorker instead of the standard Worker object.
