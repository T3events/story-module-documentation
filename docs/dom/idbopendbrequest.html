</li> <li>Using transactions: <a title="Note that as of Firefox 40, IndexedDB transactions have relaxed durability guarantees to increase performance (see bug 1112702.) Previously in a readwrite transaction IDBTransaction.oncomplete was fired only when all data was guaranteed to have been flushed to disk. In Firefox 40+ the complete event is fired after the OS has been told to write the data but potentially before that data has actually been flushed to disk. The complete event may thus be delivered quicker than before, however, there exists a small chance that the entire transaction will be lost if the OS crashes or there is a loss of system power before the data is flushed to disk. Since such catastrophic events are rare most consumers should not need to concern themselves further." href="idbtransaction"><code>IDBTransaction</code></a>
</li> <li>Setting a range of keys: <a title="A key range can be a single value or a range with upper and lower bounds or endpoints. If the key range has both upper and lower bounds, then it is bounded; if it has no bounds, it is unbounded. A bounded key range can either be open (the endpoints are excluded) or closed (the endpoints are included). To retrieve all keys within a certain range, you can use the following code constructs:" href="idbkeyrange"><code>IDBKeyRange</code></a>
</li> <li>Retrieving and making changes to your data: <a title="This example shows a variety of different uses of object stores, from updating the data structure with IDBObjectStore.createIndex inside an onupgradeneeded function, to adding a new item to our object store with IDBObjectStore.add.
