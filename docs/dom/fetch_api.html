<h1>Fetch API</h1><div class="notice experimental"> <p> <strong>This is an experimental technology</strong><br>Because this technology's specification has not stabilized, check the <a href="#Browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes.</p> </div> <p>The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used <a title="XMLHttpRequest is an API that provides client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server. It provides an easy way to retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just a part of the page without disrupting what the user is doing." href="xmlhttprequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a>, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.</p> <h2 id="Concepts_and_usage">Concepts and usage</h2> <p>Fetch provides a generic definition of <a title="The Request interface of the Fetch API represents a resource request." href="request"><code>Request</code></a> and <a title="The Response interface of the Fetch API represents the response to a request." href="response"><code>Response</code></a> objects (and other things involved with network requests). This will allow them to be used wherever they are needed in the future, whether it’s for service workers, Cache API and other similar things that handle or modify requests and responses, or any kind of use case that might require you to generate your own responses programmatically.</p> <p>It also provides a definition for related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP origin header semantics, supplanting their separate definitions elsewhere.</p> <p>For making a request and fetching a resource, use the <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch"><code>GlobalFetch.fetch</code></a> method. It is implemented in multiple interfaces, specifically <a title="The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window." href="window"><code>Window</code></a> and <a title="The WorkerGlobalScope interface of the Web Workers API is an interface representing the scope of any worker. Workers have no browsing context; this scope contains the information usually conveyed by Window objects — in this case event handlers, the console or the associated WorkerNavigator object. Each WorkerGlobalScope has its own event loop." href="workerglobalscope"><code>WorkerGlobalScope</code></a>. This makes it available in pretty much any context you might want to fetch resources in.</p> <p>The <code>fetch()</code> method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a promise that resolves to the <a title="The Response interface of the Fetch API represents the response to a request." href="response"><code>Response</code></a> to that request, whether it is successful or not. You can also optionally pass in an <code>init</code> options object as the second argument (see <a title="The Request interface of the Fetch API represents a resource request." href="request"><code>Request</code></a>.)</p> <p>Once a <a title="The Response interface of the Fetch API represents the response to a request." href="response"><code>Response</code></a> is retrieved, there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and how it should be handled (see <a title="The Body mixin of the Fetch API represents the body of the response/request, allowing you to declare what its content type is and how it should be handled." href="body"><code>Body</code></a>.)</p> <p>You can create a request and response directly using the <a title="The Request() constructor creates a new Request object." href="request/request"><code>Request()</code></a> and <a title="The Response() constructor creates a new Response object." href="response/response"><code>Response()</code></a> constructors, but you are unlikely to do this directly. Instead, these are more likely to be created as results of other API actions (for example, <a title="The respondWith() method of the FetchEvent interface is intended for containing code that generates custom responses to the requests coming from the controlled page. This code will resolve by returning a Response or network error to Fetch." href="fetchevent/respondwith"><code>FetchEvent.respondWith</code></a> from service workers.)</p> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Find out more about using the Fetch API features in <a href="fetch_api/using_fetch">Using Fetch</a>, and study concepts in <a href="fetch_api/basic_concepts">Fetch basic concepts</a>.</p> </div> <h2 id="Fetch_Interfaces">Fetch Interfaces</h2> <dl> <dt><a title="The GlobalFetch mixin of the Fetch API contains the GlobalFetch.fetch() method used to start the process of fetching a resource." href="globalfetch"><code>GlobalFetch</code></a></dt> <dd>Contains the <code>fetch()</code> method used to fetch a resource.</dd> <dt><a title="The Headers interface of the Fetch API allows you to perform various actions on HTTP request and response headers.
