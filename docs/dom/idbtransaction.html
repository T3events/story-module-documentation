<h1>IDBTransaction</h1> <div> <p>The <strong><code>IDBTransaction</code></strong> interface of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB">IndexedDB API</a> provides a static, asynchronous transaction on a database using event handler attributes. All reading and writing of data is done within transactions. You actually use <a title="Inherits from: EventTarget" href="idbdatabase"><code>IDBDatabase</code></a> to start transactions and <a title="Note that as of Firefox 40, IndexedDB transactions have relaxed durability guarantees to increase performance (see bug 1112702.) Previously in a readwrite transaction IDBTransaction.oncomplete was fired only when all data was guaranteed to have been flushed to disk.

var trans2 = db.transaction("foo", "readwrite");
trans2.put("2", "key");
trans1.put("1", "key");
