<h1>History API</h1><p>The DOM <a title="The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window." href="window"><code>window</code></a> object provides access to the browser's history through the <a title="The Window.history read-only property returns a reference to the History object, which provides an interface for manipulating the browser session history (pages visited in the tab or frame that the current page is loaded in)." href="window/history"><code>history</code></a> object. It exposes useful methods and properties that let you move back and forth through the user's history, as well as -- starting with HTML5 -- manipulate the contents of the history stack.</p> <h2 id="Traveling_through_history">Traveling through history</h2> <p>Moving backward and forward through the user's history is done using the <code>back()</code>, <code>forward()</code>, and <code>go()</code> methods.</p> <h3 id="Moving_forward_and_backward">Moving forward and backward</h3> <p>To move backward through history, just do:</p> <pre data-language="js">window.history.back();
</pre> <p>This will act exactly like the user clicked on the Back button in their browser toolbar.</p> <p>Similarly, you can move forward (as if the user clicked the Forward button), like this:</p> <pre data-language="js">window.history.forward();
</pre> <h3 id="Moving_to_a_specific_point_in_history">Moving to a specific point in history</h3> <p>You can use the <code>go()</code> method to load a specific page from session history, identified by its relative position to the current page (with the current page being, of course, relative index 0).</p> <p>To move back one page (the equivalent of calling <code>back()</code>):</p> <pre data-language="js">window.history.go(-1);
</pre> <p>To move forward a page, just like calling <code>forward()</code>:</p> <pre data-language="js">window.history.go(1);
</pre> <p>Similarly, you can move forward 2 pages by passing 2, and so forth.</p> <p>You can determine the number of pages in the history stack by looking at the value of the length property:</p> <pre data-language="js">var numberOfEntries = window.history.length;
</pre> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer supports passing string URLs as a parameter to <code>go()</code>; this is non-standard and not supported by Gecko.</div> <h2 id="Adding_and_modifying_history_entries">Adding and modifying history entries</h2>  <p>HTML5 introduced the<a href="history_api"> history.pushState()</a> and <code>history.replaceState()</code> methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. These methods work in conjunction with the <a title="An event handler for the popstate event on the window." href="windoweventhandlers/onpopstate"><code>window.onpopstate</code></a> event.</p> <p>Using <code>history.pushState()</code> changes the referrer that gets used in the HTTP header for <a title="en/XMLHttpRequest" href="xmlhttprequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> objects created after you change the state. The referrer will be the URL of the document whose window is <code>this</code> at the time of creation of the <a title="en/XMLHttpRequest" href="xmlhttprequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> object.</p> <h3 id="Example_of_pushState()_method">Example of pushState() method</h3> <p>Suppose <span class="nowiki">http://mozilla.org/foo.html</span> executes the following JavaScript:</p> <pre data-language="js">var stateObj = { foo: "bar" };
history.pushState(stateObj, "page 2", "bar.html");
</pre> <p>This will cause the URL bar to display <span class="nowiki">http://mozilla.org/bar.html</span>, but won't cause the browser to load <code>bar.html</code> or even check that <code>bar.html</code> exists.</p> <p>Suppose now that the user now navigates to <span class="nowiki">http://google.com</span>, then clicks back. At this point, the URL bar will display <span class="nowiki">http://mozilla.org/bar.html</span>, and the page will get a <code>popstate</code> event whose <em>state object</em> contains a copy of <code>stateObj</code>. The page itself will look like <code>foo.html</code>, although the page might modify its contents during the <code>popstate</code> event.</p> <p>If we click back again, the URL will change to <span class="nowiki">http://mozilla.org/foo.html</span>, and the document will get another <code>popstate</code> event, this time with a null state object. Here too, going back doesn't change the document's contents from what they were in the previous step, although the document might update its contents manually upon receiving the <code>popstate</code> event.</p> <h3 id="The_pushState()_method">The pushState() method</h3> <p><code>pushState()</code> takes three parameters: a state object, a title (which is currently ignored), and (optionally) a URL. Let's examine each of these three parameters in more detail:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>state object</strong> — The state object is a JavaScript object which is associated with the new history entry created by <code>pushState()</code>. Whenever the user navigates to the new state, a <code>popstate</code> event is fired, and the <code>state</code> property of the event contains a copy of the history entry's state object.</p> <p>The state object can be anything that can be serialized. Because Firefox saves state objects to the user's disk so they can be restored after the user restarts the browser, we impose a size limit of 640k characters on the serialized representation of a state object. If you pass a state object whose serialized representation is larger than this to <code>pushState()</code>, the method will throw an exception. If you need more space than this, you're encouraged to use <code>sessionStorage</code> and/or <code>localStorage</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>title</strong> — Firefox currently ignores this parameter, although it may use it in the future. Passing the empty string here should be safe against future changes to the method. Alternatively, you could pass a short title for the state to which you're moving.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>URL</strong> — The new history entry's URL is given by this parameter. Note that the browser won't attempt to load this URL after a call to <code>pushState()</code>, but it might attempt to load the URL later, for instance after the user restarts the browser. The new URL does not need to be absolute; if it's relative, it's resolved relative to the current URL. The new URL must be of the same origin as the current URL; otherwise, <code>pushState()</code> will throw an exception. This parameter is optional; if it isn't specified, it's set to the document's current URL.</p> </li> </ul> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> In Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 / Thunderbird 3.3 / SeaMonkey 2.1) through Gecko 5.0 (Firefox 5.0 / Thunderbird 5.0 / SeaMonkey 2.2), the passed object is serialized using JSON. Starting in Gecko 6.0 (Firefox 6.0 / Thunderbird 6.0 / SeaMonkey 2.3), the object is serialized using <a title="en/DOM/The structured clone algorithm" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/The_structured_clone_algorithm">the structured clone algorithm</a>. This allows a wider variety of objects to be safely passed.</div> <p>In a sense, calling <code>pushState()</code> is similar to setting <code>window.location = "#foo"</code>, in that both will also create and activate another history entry associated with the current document. But <code>pushState()</code> has a few advantages:</p> <ul> <li>The new URL can be any URL in the same origin as the current URL. In contrast, setting <code>window.location</code> keeps you at the same <a title="The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

In contrast, setting <code>window.location = "#foo";</code> only creates a new history entry if the current hash isn't <code>#foo</code>.</li> <li>You can associate arbitrary data with your new history entry. With the hash-based approach, you need to encode all of the relevant data into a short string.</li> <li>If <code>title </code>is subsequently used by browsers, this data can be utilized (independent of, say, the hash).</li> </ul> <p>Note that <code>pushState()</code> never causes a <code>hashchange</code> event to be fired, even if the new URL differs from the old URL only in its hash.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL">XUL</a> document, it creates the specified XUL element.</p> <p>In other documents, it creates an element with a <code>null</code> namespace URI.</p> <h3 id="Example_of_replaceState()_method">Example of replaceState() method</h3> <p>Suppose <span class="nowiki">http://mozilla.org/foo.html</span> executes the following JavaScript:</p> <pre data-language="js">var stateObj = { foo: "bar" };
history.pushState(stateObj, "page 2", "bar.html");
</pre> <p>The explanation of these two lines above can be found at "Example of pushState() method" section. Then suppose <span class="nowiki">http://mozilla.org/bar.html</span> executes the following JavaScript:</p> <pre data-language="js">history.replaceState(stateObj, "page 3", "bar2.html");
</pre> <p>This will cause the URL bar to display <span class="nowiki">http://mozilla.org/bar2.html</span>, but won't cause the browser to load <code>bar2.html</code> or even check that <code>bar2.html</code> exists.</p> <p>Suppose now that the user now navigates to <span class="nowiki">http://www.microsoft.com</span>, then clicks back. At this point, the URL bar will display <span class="nowiki">http://mozilla.org/bar2.html. If the user now clicks back again, the URL bar will display http://mozilla.org/foo.html, and totaly bypass bar.html.</span></p> <h3 id="The_replaceState()_method">The replaceState() method</h3> <p><code>history.replaceState()</code> operates exactly like <code>history.pushState()</code> except that <code>replaceState()</code> modifies the current history entry instead of creating a new one. Note that this doesn't prevent the creation of a new entry in the global browser history.</p> <p><code>replaceState()</code> is particularly useful when you want to update the state object or URL of the current history entry in response to some user action.</p> <div class="note">

If the history entry being activated was created by a call to <code>pushState</code> or affected by a call to <code>replaceState</code>, the <code>popstate</code> event's <code>state</code> property contains a copy of the history entry's state object.</p> <p>See <a title="An event handler for the popstate event on the window." href="windoweventhandlers/onpopstate"><code>window.onpopstate</code></a> for sample usage.</p> <h3 id="Reading_the_current_state">Reading the current state</h3> <p>When your page loads, it might have a non-null state object. This can happen, for example, if the page sets a state object (using <code>pushState()</code> or <code>replaceState()</code>) and then the user restarts their browser. When your page reloads, the page will receive an onload event, but no popstate event. However, if you read the history.state property, you'll get back the state object you would have gotten if a popstate had fired.</p> <p>You can read the state of the current history entry without waiting for a <code>popstate</code> event using the <code>history.state</code> property like this:</p> <pre data-language="js">var currentState = history.state;
