<h1>Web Storage API</h1> <p>The <strong>Web Storage API</strong> provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.</p> <h2 id="Web_Storage_concepts_and_usage">Web Storage concepts and usage</h2> <p>The two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>sessionStorage</code> maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)</li> <li>
<code>localStorage</code> does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.</li> </ul> <p>These mechanisms are available via the <a title="The sessionStorage property allows you to access a session Storage object. sessionStorage is similar to Window.localStorage, the only difference is while data stored in localStorage has no expiration set, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts for as long as the browser is open and survives over page reloads and restores. Opening a page in a new tab or window will cause a new session to be initiated, which differs from how session cookies work." href="window/sessionstorage"><code>Window.sessionStorage</code></a> and <a title="The localStorage property allows you to access a local Storage object. localStorage is similar to sessionStorage. The only difference is that, while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the browsing session ends—that is, when the browser is closed." href="window/localstorage"><code>Window.localStorage</code></a> properties (to be more precise, in supporting browsers the <code>Window</code> object implements the <code>WindowLocalStorage</code> and <code>WindowSessionStorage</code> objects, which the <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> properties hang off) — invoking one of these will create an instance of the <a title="The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to the session storage or local storage for a particular domain, allowing you to for example add, modify or delete stored data items." href="storage"><code>Storage</code></a> object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed. A different Storage object is used for the <code>sessionStorage</code> and <code>localStorage</code> for each origin — they function and are controlled separately.</p> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: From Firefox 45 onwards, when the browser crashes/restarts, the amount of data saved per origin is limited to 10MB. This has been done to avoid memory issues caused by excessive usage of web storage.</p> </div> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Access to Web Storage from third-party IFrames is denied if the user has <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-third-party-cookies">disabled third-party cookies</a> (Firefox implements this behaviour from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/43">version 43</a> onwards.)</p> </div> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Web Storage is not the same as <a title="Storage" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Storage">mozStorage</a> (Mozilla's XPCOM interfaces to SQLite) or the <a title="Session_store_API" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Session_store_API">Session store API</a> (an <a title="XPCOM" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPCOM">XPCOM</a> storage utility for use by extensions).</p> </div> <h2 id="Web_Storage_interfaces">Web Storage interfaces</h2> <dl> <dt><a title="The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to the session storage or local storage for a particular domain, allowing you to for example add, modify or delete stored data items." href="storage"><code>Storage</code></a></dt> <dd>Allows you to set, retrieve and remove data for a specific domain and storage type (session or local.)</dd> <dt><a title="The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window." href="window"><code>Window</code></a></dt> <dd>The Web Storage API extends the <a title="The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window." href="window"><code>Window</code></a> object with two new properties — <a title="The sessionStorage property allows you to access a session Storage object. sessionStorage is similar to Window.localStorage, the only difference is while data stored in localStorage has no expiration set, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends.

The <a href="http://mdn.github.io/web-storage-demo/">landing page</a> provides controls that can be used to customize the colour, font and decorative image. When you choose different options, the page is instantly updated; in addition your choices are stored in <code>localStorage</code>, so that when you leave the page then load it again later on your choices are remembered.</p> <p>In addition, we have provided an <a href="http://mdn.github.io/web-storage-demo/event.html">event output page</a> — if you load this page in another tab, then make changes to your choices in the landing page, you'll see the updated storage information outputted as the <code><a title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/StorageEvent" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/StorageEvent">StorageEvent</a></code> is fired.</p> <h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2> <table class="standard-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="col">Specification</th> <th scope="col">Status</th> <th scope="col">Comment</th> </tr> <tr> <td><a lang="en" title="The 'Web Storage (Second edition)' specification" class="external" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html" hreflang="en">Web Storage (Second edition)</a></td> <td><span class="spec-REC">Recommendation</span></td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="Browser_compatibility">Browser compatibility</h2>  <div id="compat-desktop"> <table class="compat-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Chrome</th> <th>Firefox (Gecko)</th> <th>Internet Explorer</th> <th>Opera</th> <th>Safari (WebKit)</th> </tr> <tr> <td>localStorage</td> <td>4</td> <td>3.5</td> <td>8</td> <td>10.50</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>sessionStorage</td> <td>5</td> <td>2</td> <td>8</td> <td>10.50</td> <td>4</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id="compat-mobile"> <table class="compat-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Android</th> <th>Firefox Mobile (Gecko)</th> <th>IE Phone</th> <th>Opera Mobile</th> <th>Safari Mobile</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Basic support</td> <td>2.1</td> <td><span title="Compatibility unknown; please update this." style="color: rgb(255, 153, 0);">?</span></td> <td>8</td> <td>11</td> <td>iOS 3.2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>All browsers have varying capacity levels for both localStorage and sessionStorage. Here is a <a title="http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/" href="http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/" class="external">detailed rundown of all the storage capacities for various browsers</a>.</p> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note: </strong>since iOS 5.1, Safari Mobile stores localStorage data in the cache folder, which is subject to occasional clean up, at the behest of the OS, typically if space is short.</p> </div> <h2 id="Private_Browsing_Incognito_modes">Private Browsing / Incognito modes</h2> <p>Most modern browsers support a privacy option called 'Incognito', 'Private Browsing' or something similar that doesn't store data like history and cookies. This is fundamentally incompatible with Web Storage for obvious reasons. As such, browser vendors are experimenting with different scenarios for how to deal with this incompatibility.</p> <p>Most browsers have opted for a strategy where storage APIs are still available and seemingly fully functional, with the one big difference that all stored data is wiped after the browser is closed. For these browsers there are still different interpretations of what should be done with existing stored data (from a regular browsing session). Should it be available to read when in Private mode? Then there are some browsers, most notably Safari, that have opted for a solution where storage is available, but is empty and has a quota of 0 bytes assigned, effectively making it impossible to write data to it.</p> <p>Developers should be aware of these different implementations and take them into account when developing websites depending on Web Storage APIs.
