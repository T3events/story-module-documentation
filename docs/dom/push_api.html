<h1>Push API</h1><div><div class="notice experimental"> <p> <strong>This is an experimental technology</strong><br>Because this technology's specification has not stabilized, check the <a href="#Browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes.</p> </div></div> <p>The <strong>Push API</strong> gives web applications the ability to receive messages pushed to them from a server, whether or not the web app is in the foreground, or even currently loaded, on a user agent. This lets developers deliver asynchronous notifications and updates to users that opt in, resulting in better engagement with timely new content.</p> <h2 id="Push_concepts_and_usage">Push concepts and usage</h2> <p>For an app to receive push messages, it has to have an active <a href="service_worker_api">service worker</a>. When the service worker is active, it can subscribe to push notifications using <a href="pushmanager/subscribe" title="The subscribe() method of the PushManager interface subscribes to a push service."><code>PushManager.subscribe()</code></a>.</p> <p>The resulting <a href="pushsubscription" title="The PushSubscription interface of the Push API provides a subcription's URL endpoint and allows unsubscription from a push service."><code>PushSubscription</code></a> includes all the information that the application needs to send a push message: an endpoint and the encryption key needed for sending data.</p> <p>The service worker will be started as necessary to handle incoming push messages, which are delivered to the <a href="serviceworkerglobalscope/onpush" title="The ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.onpush event of the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope interface is fired whenever a push message is received by a service worker via a push server."><code>ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.onpush</code></a> event handler. This allows apps to react to push messages being received, for example by displaying a notification (using <a href="serviceworkerregistration/shownotification" title="The showNotification() method of the ServiceWorkerRegistration interface creates a notification on an active service worker."><code>ServiceWorkerRegistration.showNotification()</code></a>.)</p> <p>Each subscription is unique to a service worker. The endpoint for the subscription is a unique <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/">capability URL</a>: knowledge of the endpoint is all that is necessary to send a message to your application. The endpoint URL therefore needs to be kept secret, or other applications might be able to send push messages to your application.</p> <p>Activating a service worker to deliver a push message can result in increased resource usage, particularly of the battery. Different browsers have different schemes for handling this — there is currently no standard mechanism. Firefox allows a limited number (quota) of push messages to be sent to an application, although Push messages that generate notifications are exempt from this limit. The limit is refreshed each time the site is visited. In comparison, Chrome applies no limit but requires that every push message causes a notification to be displayed.</p> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: As of Gecko 44, the allowed quota of push messages per application is not incremented when a new notification fires when another is still visible, for a period of three seconds. This handles cases where a burst of notifications is received, and not all generate a visible notification.</p> </div> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Chrome versions earlier than 52 require you to set up a project on <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/">Google Cloud Messaging</a> to send push messages, and use the associated project number and API key when sending push notifications. It also requires an app manifest with some special parameters to use this service.</p> </div> <h2 id="Interfaces">Interfaces</h2> <dl> <dt><a href="pushevent" title="The PushEvent interface of the Push API represents a push message that has been received.
