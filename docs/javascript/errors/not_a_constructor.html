The constructor initializes this object and can provide access to its private information. The concept of a constructor can be applied to most object-oriented programming languages.

However, some global objects are not and their properties and methods are static. The following JavaScript standard built-in objects are not a constructor: <a href="../global_objects/math" title="Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Not a function object."><code>Math</code></a>, <a href="../global_objects/json" title="The JSON object contains methods for parsing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and converting values to JSON. It can't be called or constructed, and aside from its two method properties it has no interesting functionality of its own."><code>JSON</code></a>, <a href="../global_objects/symbol" title='The Symbol() function returns a value of type symbol, has static properties that expose several members of built-in objects, has static methods that expose the global symbol registry, and resembles a built-in object class but is incomplete as a contructor because it does not support the syntax "new Symbol()".'><code>Symbol</code></a>, <a href="../global_objects/reflect" title="Reflect is a built-in object that provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations.

SIMD operations perform the same computation on multiple data points resulting in data level parallelism and thus performance gains, for example for 3D graphics and video processing, physics simulations or cryptography, and other domains.'><code>SIMD</code></a>, <a href="../global_objects/atomics" title="The Atomics object provides atomic operations as static methods.

</pre> <h3 id="A_car_constructor">A car constructor</h3> <p>Suppose you want to create an object type for cars. You want this type of object to be called <code>car</code>, and you want it to have properties for make, model, and year. To do this, you would write the following function:</p> <pre data-language="js">function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}
</pre> <p>Now you can create an object called <code>mycar</code> as follows:</p> <pre data-language="js">var mycar = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);</pre> <h3 id="In_Promises">In Promises</h3> <p>When returning an immediately-resolved or immediately-rejected Promise, you do not need to create a <em>new Promise(...)</em> and act on it.</p> <p>This is not legal (the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm/Promise#Constructor">Promise constructor</a> is not being called correctly) and will throw a <code>TypeError: this is not a constructor</code> exception:</p> <pre data-language="js">return new Promise.resolve(true);
</pre> <p>Instead, use the<a href="../global_objects/promise/resolve"> Promise.resolve()</a> or <a href="../global_objects/promise/reject">Promise.reject()</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)#Static_methods">static methods</a>:</p> <pre data-language="js">// This is legal, but unnecessarily long:
