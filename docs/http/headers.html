<h1>Headers</h1> <p>HTTP headers allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response. A request header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon '<code>:</code>', then by its value (without line breaks). Leading white space before the value is ignored.</p> <p>Custom proprietary headers can be added using the 'X-' prefix, but this convention was deprecated in June 2012, because of the inconveniences it caused when non-standard fields became standard in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648">RFC 6648</a>; others are listed in an <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html" class="external">IANA registry</a>, whose original content was defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4229" class="external">RFC 4229</a>. IANA also maintains a <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/prov-headers.html" class="external">registry of proposed new HTTP message headers</a>.</p> <p>Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/General_header" class="glossaryLink" title="General header: A general header is an HTTP header that can be used for both, request and response messages, but don't apply to the content itself.

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header" class="glossaryLink" title="Response header: A response header is an HTTP header that can be used in an HTTP response and that doesn't relate to the content of the message.
