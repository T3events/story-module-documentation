</pre> <p>With the above header set on a domain example.com that wants to migrate from HTTP to HTTPS, non-navigational insecure resource requests are automatically upgraded (first-party as well as third-party requests).</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;img src="http://example.com/image.png"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://not-example.com/image.png"&gt;</pre> <p>These URLs will be rewritten before the request is made, meaning that no insecure requests will hit the network.
