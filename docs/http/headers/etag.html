<h1>ETag</h1> <p>The <code>ETag</code> HTTP response header is an identifier for a specific version of a resource. It allows caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. On the other side, if the content has changed, etags are useful to help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other ("mid-air collisions").</p> <p>If the resource at a given URL changes, a new <code>Etag</code> value must be generated. Etags are therefore similar to fingerprints and might also be used for tracking purposes by some servers. A comparison of them allows to quickly determine whether two representations of a resource are the same, but they might also be set to persist indefinitely by a tracking server.</p> <table class="properties"> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="row">Header type</th> <td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header" class="glossaryLink" title="Response header: A response header is an HTTP header that can be used in an HTTP response and that doesn't relate to the content of the message.

<code>'W/'</code> (case-sensitive) indicates that a <a href="../conditional_requests#Weak_validation">weak validator</a> is used. Weak validators are easy to generate but are far less useful for comparisons. Strong validators are ideal for comparisons but can be very difficult to generate efficiently. Weak <code>Etag</code> values of two representations of the same resources might be semantically equivalent, but not byte-for-byte identical.</dd> <dt>"&lt;etag_value&gt;"</dt> <dd>Entity tags uniquely representing the requested resources. They are a string of ASCII characters placed between double quotes (Like <code>"675af34563dc-tr34"</code>). The method by which <code>ETag</code> values are generated is not specified. Oftentimes, a hash of the content, a hash of the last modification timestamp, or just a revision number is used. For example, MDN uses a hash of hexadecimal digits of the wiki content.</dd> </dl> <h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2> <pre>ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
