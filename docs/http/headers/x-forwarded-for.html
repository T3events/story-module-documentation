<h1>X-Forwarded-For</h1> <p>The <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> (XFF) header is a de-facto standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer. When traffic is intercepted between clients and servers, server access logs contain the IP address of the proxy or load balancer only. To see the original IP address of the client, the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> request header is used.</p> <p>This header is used for debugging, statistics, and generating location-dependent content and by design it exposes privacy sensitive information, such as the IP address of the client. Therefore the user's privacy must be kept in mind when deploying this header.</p> <p>A standardized version of this header is the HTTP <a title="The Forwarded header contains information from the client-facing side of proxy servers that is altered or lost when a proxy is involved in the path of the request." href="forwarded"><code>Forwarded</code></a> header.</p> <p><code>X-Forwarded-For</code> is also an email-header indicating that an email-message was forwarded from another account.</p> <table class="properties"> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="row">Header type</th> <td><a title="Request header: A request header is an HTTP header that can be used in an HTTP request, and that doesn't relate to the content of the message.
