<h1>MIME Types</h1> <p>The <strong>MIME type</strong> is the mechanism to tell the client the variety of document transmitted: the extension of a file name has no meaning on the web. It is, therefore, important that the server is correctly set up, so that the correct MIME type is transmitted with each document. Browsers often use the MIME-type to determine what default action to do when a resource is fetched.</p> <p>There are many kinds of documents, so there are many MIME types. In this article, we will list the most important for Web development, but you can find ones for applicable document types in this dedicated article: <a href="mime_types/complete_list_of_mime_types">Complete list of MIME types</a>.</p> <p>MIME types are not the only way to convey the document type information:</p> <ul> <li>Name suffixes are sometimes used, especially on Microsoft Windows systems. Not all operating systems consider these suffixes meaningful (especially Linux and Mac OS), and like an external MIME type, there is no guarantee they are correct.</li> <li>Magic numbers. The syntax of the different kind of files often allow to determine the type by looking at the structure. E.g. each GIF files starts with the 47 49 46 38 hexadecimal value [GIF89] or PNG files with 89 50 4E 47 [.PNG]. Not all types of files have magic numbers, so this is not a 100% reliable system either.</li> </ul> <p>On the Web, only the MIME type is relevant and has therefore to be set carefully. Browsers and servers often used heuristics based on suffixes or magic numbers to define the MIME type, to check for coherence, or to find the correct MIME type when only a generic type has been provided.</p> <h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2> <h3 id="General_structure">General structure</h3> <pre class="syntaxbox">type/subtype</pre> <p>The structure of a MIME type is very simple; it consists of a type and a subtype, two strings, separated by a <code>'/'</code>. No space is allowed. The <em>type</em> represents the category and can be a <em>discrete</em> or a <em>multipart</em> type. The <em>subtype</em> is specific to each type.</p> <p>A MIME type is insensitive to the case, but traditionally is written all in lower case.</p> <h3 id="Discrete_types">Discrete types</h3> <pre class="syntaxbox">text/plain
text/html
image/jpeg
image/png
audio/mpeg
audio/ogg
audio/*
video/mp4
application/octet-stream
…</pre> <p><em>Discrete</em> types indicates the category of the document, it can be one of the following:</p> <table class="standard-table"> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col">Type</th> <th scope="col">Description</th> <th scope="col">Example of typical subtypes</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>text</code></td> <td>Represents any document that contains text and is theoretically human readable</td> <td>
<code>text/plain</code>, <code>text/html</code>, <code>text/css, text/javascript</code>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>image</code></td> <td>Represents any kind of images. Videos are not included, though animated images (like animated gif) are describes with an image type.</td> <td>
<code>image/gif</code>, <code>image/png</code>, <code>image/jpeg</code>, <code>image/bmp</code>, <code>image/webp</code>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>audio</code></td> <td>Represents any kind of audio files</td> <td>
<code>audio/midi</code>, <code>audio/mpeg, audio/webm, audio/ogg, audio/wav</code>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>video</code></td> <td>Represents any kind of video files</td> <td>
<code>video/webm</code>, <code>video/ogg</code>
</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>application</code></td> <td>Represents any kind of binary data.</td> <td>
<code>application/octet-stream</code>, <code>application/pkcs12</code>, <code>application/vnd.mspowerpoint</code>, <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, <code>application/xml</code>, <code>application/pdf</code>
</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For text documents without specific subtype, <code>text/plain</code> should be used. Similarly for binary documents without specific or known subtype, <code>application/octet-stream</code> should be used.</p> <h3 id="Multipart_types">Multipart types</h3> <pre class="syntaxbox">multipart/form-data
multipart/byteranges</pre> <p id="sect1"><em>Multipart</em> types indicates a category of document that are broken in distinct parts, often with different MIME types. It is a way to represent <em>composite</em> document. With the exception of <code>multipart/form-data</code>, that are used in relation of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms">HTML Forms</a> and <a title="The HTTP POST method sends data to the server.

As it really means <em>unknown binary </em> file, browsers usually don't automatically execute it, or even ask if it should be execute. They treat it as if the <a title="In a multipart/form-data body, the HTTP Content-Disposition general header is a header that can be used on the subpart of a multipart body to give information about the field it applies to. The subpart is delimited by the boundary defined in the Content-Type header.

Even if it really means <em>unknown textual</em> file, browsers assume they can display it.</p> <div class="note"> <p>Note that <code>text/plain</code> doesn't means <em>any kind of textual data</em>. if they expect a specific kind of textual data, they will likely not consider it a match. Specifically if they download a <code>text/plain</code> file from a <a title="The HTML &lt;link&gt; element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. Possible uses for this element include defining a relational framework for navigation.

The CSS mime type <code>text/css</code> must be used.</p> </div> <h3 id="textcss"><code>text/css</code></h3> <p>Any CSS files that have to be interpreted as such in a Web page<strong> must</strong> be of the <code>text/css</code> files. Often servers doesn't recognized files with the <code>.css</code> suffix as CSS files and send them with <code>text/plain</code> or <code>application/octet-stream</code> MIME type: in these cases, they won't be recognized as CSS files by most browsers and will be silently ignored. Special attention has to be paid to serve CSS files with the correct type.</p> <h3 id="texthtml"><code>text/html</code></h3> <p>All HTML content should be served with this type. Alternative MIME types for XHTML, like <code>application/xml+html</code>, are mostly useless nowadays (HTML5 unified these formats).</p> <h3 id="Images_types">Images types</h3> <p>Only a handful of image types are widely recognized and are considered Web safe, ready for use in a Web page:</p> <table class="standard-table"> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col">MIME type</th> <th scope="col">Image type</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>image/gif</code></td> <td>GIF images (lossless compression, superseded by PNG)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>image/jpeg</code></td> <td>JPEG images</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>image/png</code></td> <td>PNG images</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>image/svg+xml</code></td> <td>SVG images (vector images)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>There is discussion to add WebP (<code>image/webp</code>) to this list, but as each new image type will increase the size of a codebase, this may introduce new security problems, so browser vendors are cautious in accepting it.</p> <p>Other kinds of images can be found in Web documents. For example, many browsers support icon image types for favicons or similar. In particular, ICO images are supported in this context with the <code>image/x-icon </code>MIME type.</p> <h3 id="Audio_and_video_types">Audio and video types</h3> <p>Like images, HTML doesn't define a set of supported types to use with the <a title="The HTML &lt;audio&gt; element is used to embed sound content in documents.

For security reasons, most browsers do not allow setting a custom default action for such resources, forcing the user to store it to disk to use it. Some commonly seen incorrect server configurations happen with the following file types:</p> <ul> <li> <p>RAR-encoded files. In this case, the ideal would be to set the true type of the encoded files; this is often not possible (as it may not be known to the server and these files may contain several resources of different types). In this case, configuring the server to send the <code>application/x-rar-compressed</code> MIME type, users will not have defined a useful default action for them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Audio and video files. Only resources with the correct MIME Type will be recognized and played in <a title="Use the  HTML &lt;video&gt; element to embed video content in a document.

Servers can block MIME sniffing by sending the <a title="The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed.
