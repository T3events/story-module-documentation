<h1>Access control CORS</h1> <p>A resource makes a <strong>cross-origin HTTP request</strong> when it requests a resource from a different domain than the one which the first resource itself serves. For example, an HTML page served from http://domain-a.com makes an <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Img#Attributes">&lt;img&gt; src</a></code> request for http://domain-b.com/image.jpg. Many pages on the web today load resources like CSS stylesheets, images and scripts from separate domains.</p> <p>For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from within scripts. For example, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest" title="XMLHttpRequest is an API that provides client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server. It provides an easy way to retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.

The client can specify a specific URL for the OPTIONS method, or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server."><code>OPTIONS</code></a> method. The browser determines that it needs to send this based on the request parameters that the JavaScript code snippet above was using, so that the server can respond whether it is acceptable to send the request with the actual request parameters. OPTIONS is an HTTP/1.1 method that is used to determine further information from servers, and is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/safe" class="glossaryLink" title="safe: An HTTP method is safe if it doesn't alter the state of the server.

All safe methods are also idempotent as well as some, but not all, unsafe methods like PUT, or DELETE.">safe</a> method, meaning that it can't be used to change the resource. Note that along with the OPTIONS request, two other request headers are sent (lines 10 and 11 respectively):</p> <pre>Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type
</pre> <p>The <a href="headers/access-control-request-method" title="The Access-Control-Request-Method request header is used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know which HTTP method will be used when the actual request is made. This header is necessary as the preflight request is always an OPTIONS and doesn't use the same method as the actual request."><code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code></a> header notifies the server as part of a preflight request that when the actual request is sent, it will be sent with a <code>POST</code> request method. The <a href="headers/access-control-request-headers" title="The Access-Control-Request-Headers request header is used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know which HTTP headers will be used when the actual request is made."><code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code></a> header notifies the server that when the actual request is sent, it will be sent with a <code>X-PINGOTHER</code> and Content-Type custom headers. The server now has an opportunity to determine whether it wishes to accept a request under these circumstances.</p> <p>Lines 14 - 26 above are the response that the server sends back indicating that the request method (<code>POST</code>) and request headers (<code>X-PINGOTHER</code>) are acceptable. In particular, let's look at lines 17-20:</p> <pre>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://foo.example
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400</pre> <p>The server responds with <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code> and says that <code>POST</code>, <code>GET</code>, and <code>OPTIONS</code> are viable methods to query the resource in question. Note that this header is similar to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Allow" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>Allow</code></a> response header, but used strictly within the context of access control.</p> <p>The server also sends <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> with a value of "<code>X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type</code>", confirming that these are permitted headers to be used with the actual request. Like <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code>, <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> is a comma separated list of acceptable headers.</p> <p>Finally, <a href="headers/access-control-max-age" title="The Access-Control-Max-Age response header indicates how long the results of a preflight request (that is the information contained in the Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers headers) can be cached."><code>Access-Control-Max-Age</code></a> gives the value in seconds for how long the response to the preflight request can be cached for without sending another preflight request. In this case, 86400 seconds is 24 hours. Note that each browser has a<a href="headers/access-control-max-age"> maximum internal value</a> that takes precedence when the <code>Access-Control-Max-Age</code> is greater.</p> <h4 id="Preflighted_requests_and_redirects">Preflighted requests and redirects</h4> <p>Most browsers currently don’t support following redirects for preflighted requests. If a redirect occurs for a preflighted request, most current browsers will report an error message such as the following.</p> <blockquote> <p>The request was redirected to 'https://example.com/foo', which is disallowed for cross-origin requests that require preflight</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Request requires preflight, which is disallowed to follow cross-origin redirect</p> </blockquote> <p>The CORS protocol originally required that behavior but <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/commit/0d9a4db8bc02251cc9e391543bb3c1322fb882f2">was subsquently changed to no longer require it</a>. However, most browsers have not yet implemented the change and still exhibit the behavior that was originally required.</p> <p>So until browsers catch up with the spec, you may be able to work around this limitation by doing one or both of the following:</p> <ul> <li>change the server-side behavior to avoid the preflight and/or to avoid the redirect—if you have control over the server the request is being made to</li> <li>change the request such that it is a <a href="en-us/docs/web/http/access_control_cors#Simple_requests">simple request</a> that doesn’t cause a preflight</li> </ul> <p>But if it’s not possible to make those changes, then another way that may be possible is to this:</p> <ol> <li>Make a <a href="access_control_cors#Simple_requests">simple request</a> to determine (using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/url">Response.url</a> for the Fetch API, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/responseURL">XHR.responseURL</a> to determine what URL the real preflighted request would end up at).</li> <li>Make another request (the “real” request) using the URL you obtained from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/url">Response.url</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/responseURL">XMLHttpRequest.responseURL</a> in the first step.</li> </ol> <p>However, if the request is one that triggers a preflight due to the presence of the `Authorization` header in the request, you won’t be able to use the steps above to work around the limitation using the steps above. And you won’t be able to work around it all unless you have control over the server the request is being made to.</p> <h3 id="Requests_with_credentials">Requests with credentials</h3> <p>The most interesting capability exposed by both <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest" title="XMLHttpRequest is an API that provides client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server.
