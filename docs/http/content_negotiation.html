<h1>Content negotiation</h1> <p class="summary">In <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP">HTTP</a>, <em><strong>content negotiation</strong></em> is the mechanism that is used for serving different representations of a resource at the same URI, so that the user agent can specify which is best suited for the user (for example, which language of a document, which image format, or which content encoding).</p> <h2 id="Principles_of_content_negotiation">Principles of content negotiation</h2> <p>A specific document is called a <em>resource</em>. When a client wants to obtain it, it requests it using its URL. The server uses this URL to choose one of the variants it provides – each variant being called a <em>representation</em> – and returns this specific representation to the client. The overall resource, as well as each of the representations, have a specific URL. How a specific the representation is chosen when the resource is called is determined by <em>content negotiation</em> and there are several ways of negotiating between the client and the server.</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13789/HTTPNego.png" alt="" style="height: 311px; width: 767px;"></p> <p>The determination of the best suited representation is made through one of two mechanisms:</p> <ul> <li>Specific <a href="headers">HTTP headers</a> by the client (<em>server-driven negotiation</em> or <em>proactive negotiation</em>), which is the standard way of negotiating a specific kind of resource.</li> <li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/300" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>300</code></a> (Multiple Choices) or <a href="status/406" title="The HTTP 406 Not Acceptable client error response code indicates that a response matching the list of acceptable values defined in Accept-Charset and Accept-Language cannot be served."><code>406</code></a> (Not Acceptable) <a href="status">HTTP response codes</a> by the server (<em>agent-driven negotiation</em> or <em>reactive negotiation</em>), that are used as fallback mechanisms.</li> </ul> <p>Over the years, other content negotiation proposals, like <em>transparent content negotiation</em> and the <code>Alternates</code> header, have been proposed. They failed to get traction and got abandoned.</p> <h2 id="Server-driven_content_negotiation">Server-driven content negotiation</h2> <p>In <em>server-driven content negotiation</em>, or proactive content negotiation, the browser (or any other kind of user-agent) sends several HTTP headers along with the URL. These headers describe the preferred choice of the user. The server uses them as hints and an internal algorithm chooses the best content to serve to the client. The algorithm is server-specific and not defined in the standard. See, for example, the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/content-negotiation.html#algorithm" class="external">Apache 2.2 negotiation algorithm</a>.</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13791/HTTPNegoServer.png" alt="" style="height: 380px; width: 767px;"></p> <p>The HTTP/1.1 standard defines list of the standard headers that start server-driven negotiation (<a href="headers/accept" title="The Accept request HTTP header advertises which content types, expressed as MIME types, the client is able to understand. Using content negotiation, the server then selects one of the proposals, uses it and informs the client of its choice with the Content-Type response header.

The server uses the <a href="headers/vary" title="The Vary HTTP response header determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server.

Client hints advertise what kind of device the user agent runs on (for example, if it is a desktop computer or a mobile device).</p> <p>Even if server-driven content negotiation is the most common way to agree on a specific representation of a resource, it has several drawbacks:</p> <ul> <li>The server doesn't have total knowledge of the browser. Even with the Client Hints extension, it has not a complete knowledge of the capabilities of the browser. Unlike reactive content negotiation where the client makes the choice, the server choice is always somewhat arbitrary.</li> <li>The information by the client is quite verbose (HTTP/2 header compression mitigates this problem) and a privacy risk (HTTP fingerprinting)</li> <li>As several representations of a given resource are sent, shared caches are less efficient and server implementations are more complex.</li> </ul> <h3 id="The_Accept_header">The <code>Accept</code> header</h3> <p>The <a href="headers/accept" title="The Accept request HTTP header advertises which content types, expressed as MIME types, the client is able to understand.

It is a list of values with quality factors (like: <code>"de, en;q=0.7</code>").

Site designers must not be over-zealous by using language detection via this header as it can lead to a poor user experience:</p> <ul> <li>They should always provide a way to overcome the server-chosen language, e.g., by providing a language menu on the site. Most user-agents provide a default value for the <code>Accept-Language</code> header, adapted to the user interface language and end users often do not modify it, either by not knowing how, or by not being able to do it, as in an Internet café for instance.</li> <li>Once a user has overridden the server-chosen language, a site should no longer use language detection and should stick with the explicitly-chosen language. In other words, only entry pages of a site should select the proper language using this header.</li> </ul> <h3 id="The_User-Agent_header">The <code>User-Agent</code> header</h3> <div class="note"> <p>Though there are legitimate uses of this header for selecting content, <a href="browser_detection_using_the_user_agent">it is considered bad practice</a> to rely on it to define what features are supported by the user agent.</p> </div> <p>The <a href="headers/user-agent" title="The User-Agent request header contains a characteristic string that allows the network protocol peers to identify the application type, operating system, software vendor or software version of the requesting software user agent."><code>User-Agent</code></a> header identifies the browser sending the request.

There may be as many of them as the user-agent wants. A <em>comment</em> is a free string delimited by parentheses. Obviously parentheses cannot be used in that string.

It is used by the server to indicate which headers it used when selecting a representation of a resource in a content negotiation algorithm."><code>Vary</code></a> HTTP header is sent by the web server in its response. It indicates the list of headers used by the server during the server-driven content negotiation phase. The header is needed in order to inform the cache of the decision criteria so that can reproduce it, allowing the cache to be functional while preventing serving erroneous content to the user.</p> <p>The special value of '<code>*</code>' means that the server-driven content negotiation also uses information not conveyed in a header to choose the appropriate content.</p> <p>The <code>Vary</code> header was added in the version 1.1 of HTTP and is necessary in order to allow caches to work appropriately. A cache, in order to work with agent-driven content negotiation, needs to know which criteria was used by the server to select the transmitted content. That way, the cache can replay the algorithm and will be able to serve acceptable content directly, without more request to the server. Obviously, the wildcard '<code>*</code>' prevents caching from occurring, as the cache cannot know what element is behind it.</p> <h2 id="Agent-driven_negotiation">Agent-driven negotiation</h2> <p>Server-driven negotiation suffers from a few downsides: it doesn't scale well. There is one header per feature used in the negotiation. If you want to use screen size, resolution or other dimensions, a new HTTP header must be created. Sending of the headers must be done on every request. This is not too problematic with few headers, but with the eventual multiplications of them, the message size would lead to a decrease in performance. The more precise headers are sent, the more entropy is sent, allowing for more HTTP fingerprinting and corresponding privacy concern.</p> <p>From the beginnings of HTTP, the protocol allowed another negotiation type: <em>agent-driven negotiation</em> or <em>reactive negotiation</em>. In this negotiation, when facing an ambiguous request, the server sends back a page containing links to the available alternative resources. The user is presented the resources and choose the one to use.</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13795/HTTPNego3.png" alt=""></p> <p>Unfortunately, the HTTP standard does not specify the format of the page allowing to choose between the available resource, which prevents to easily automatize the process. Besides falling back to the <em>server-driven negotiation</em>, this method is almost always used in conjunction with scripting, especially with JavaScript redirection: after having checked for the negotiation criteria, the script performs the redirection. A second problem is that one more request is needed in order to fetch the real resource, slowing the availability of the resource to the user.</p><div class="_attribution">
