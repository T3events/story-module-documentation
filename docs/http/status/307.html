<h1>307 Temporary Redirect</h1> <p>The HTTP <code>307 Temporary Redirect</code> redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the <a href="../headers/location" title="The Location response header indicates the URL to redirect a page to. It only provides a meaning when served with a 3xx status response."><code>Location</code></a> headers. A browser redirects to this page, but search engines don't update their links to the resource (In SEO-speak, it is said that the link-juice is not sent to the new URL).</p> <p>The method and the body of the original request are reused to perform the redirected request. In the cases where you want the method used to be changed to <a href="../methods/get" title="The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data."><code>GET</code></a>, use <a href="303" title="The HTTP 303 See Other redirect status response code, usually sent back as a result of a PUT or POST operation, indicates that the redirects don't link to the newly uploaded resources but to another page, like a confirmation page or an upload progress page. The method used to display this redirected page is always GET."><code>303</code></a> <code>See Also</code> instead. This is useful when you want to give an answer to a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>PUT</code></a> method that is not the uploaded resources, but a confirmation message (like "You successfully uploaded XYZ").</p> <p>The only difference between <code>307</code> and <a href="302" title="The HTTP 302 Found redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location headers. A browser redirects to this page, but search engines don't update their links to the resource (In SEO-speak, it is said that the link-juice is not sent to the new URL)."><code>302</code></a> is that <code>307</code> guarantees that the method and the body will not be changed when the redirected request is made. With <code>302</code>, some old clients were incorrectly changing the method to <a href="../methods/get" title="The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data."><code>GET</code></a>: the behavior with non-<code>GET</code> methods and <code>302</code> is then unpredictable on the Web, whereas the <code>307</code> one is. For <code>GET</code> requests, their behavior is identical.</p> <h2 id="Status">Status</h2> <pre class="syntaxbox">307 Temporary Redirect
