<h1>Cookies</h1> <p class="summary">An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser, that may store it and send it back together with the next request to the same server. Typically, it's used to know if two requests came from the same browser allowing to keep a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.</p> <p>Cookies are mainly used for these three purposes:</p> <ul> <li>Session management (user logins, shopping carts)</li> <li>Personalization (user preferences)</li> <li>Tracking (analyzing user behavior)</li> </ul> <p>Cookies have also been used for general client-side storage. While this use could have been considered legitimate at a time when there was no other way to store data on the client side, it is no longer the case nowadays where web browsers are capable of using various storage APIs. Since cookies are sent along with every request, it can be an additional performance burden (especially for mobile web). New APIs to consider for local storage are the <a title="DOM Storage" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">Web storage API</a> (<code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>) and<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API"> IndexedDB</a>.</p> <div class="note"> <p>To see stored cookies (and other various types of storage that a web page can use), you can enable the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector">Storage Inspector</a> in the Developer Tools and select the Cookies storage type from the storage tree.</p> </div> <h2 id="Creating_cookies">Creating cookies</h2> <p>When receiving an HTTP request, a server can send a <a title="The Set-Cookie HTTP response header is used to send cookies from the server to the user agent." href="headers/set-cookie"><code>Set-Cookie</code></a> header with the response. The cookie is usually stored by the browser and, afterwards, the cookie value is sent along with every request made to the same server as the content of a <a title="The Cookie HTTP request header contains stored HTTP cookies previously sent by the server with the Set-Cookie header." href="headers/cookie"><code>Cookie</code></a> HTTP header. Additionally, an expiration delay can be specified as well as restrictions to a specific domain and path, limiting how long and to which site the cookie is sent to.</p> <h3 id="The_Set-Cookie_and_Cookie_headers">The <code>Set-Cookie</code> and Cookie headers</h3> <p>The <a title="The Set-Cookie HTTP response header is used to send cookies from the server to the user agent." href="headers/set-cookie"><code>Set-Cookie</code></a> HTTP response header is used to send cookies from the server to the user agent. A simple cookie can be set like this:</p> <pre class="syntaxbox">Set-Cookie: &lt;cookie-name&gt;=&lt;cookie-value&gt;</pre> <p>The server tells the client to store a cookie (for example, applications like <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php">PHP</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/http.html#http_response_setheader_name_value">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html">Python</a>, or <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies.html">Ruby on Rails</a> do it). The response sent to the browser will contain the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header and the browser will store the cookie.</p> <pre>HTTP/1.0 200 OK

They don't specify any <code>Expires</code> or <code>Max-Age</code> directives. Note, however, that web browsers often have session restoring enabled, which will make most session cookies actually permanent as if the browser was never closed.</p> <h3 id="Permanent_cookies">Permanent cookies</h3> <p>Instead of expiring when the client is closed, <em>permanent cookies</em> expire at a specific date (<code>Expires</code>) or after a specific length of time (<code>Max-Age</code>).</p> <pre>Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT;</pre> <h3 id="Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies">Secure and <code>HttpOnly</code> cookies</h3> <p>A secure cookie will only be sent to the server when a request is made using SSL and the HTTPS protocol.

<code>SameSite</code> cookies 
</h3> <p><code>SameSite</code> cookies allow servers to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-site requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (<a title="CSRF: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that impersonates a trusted user and sends a website unwanted commands.

So stealing a cookie from a web application can lead to hijacking the authenticated user's session. Common ways to steal cookies include using Social Engineering or by exploiting an <a title="XSS: Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side code into a website, which is then executed by the victims.

In this situation, someone includes an image that isn’t really an image (for example in an unfiltered chat or forum), instead it really is a request to your bank’s server to withdraw money:</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;img src="http://bank.example.com/withdraw?account=bob&amp;amount=1000000&amp;for=mallory"&gt;</pre> <p>Now, if you are logged into your bank account and your cookies are still valid (and there is no other validation), you will transfer money as soon as you load the HTML that contains this image.

If this domain is the same as the domain of the page you are on, the cookies is said to be a <em>first-party cookie</em>. If the domain is different, it is said to be a <em>third-party cookie</em>. While first-party cookies are sent only to the server setting them, a web page may contain images or other components stored on servers in other domains (like ad banners). Cookies that are sent through these third-party components are called third-party cookies and are mainly used for advertising and tracking across the web. See for example the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">types of cookies used by Google</a>. Most browsers allow third-party cookies by default, but there are add-ons available to block them (for example, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/">Privacy Badger</a> by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>).</p> <p>If you are not disclosing third-party cookies, consumer trust might get harmed if cookie use is discovered. A clear disclosure (such as in a privacy policy) tends to eliminate any negative effects of a cookie discovery. Some countries also have legislation about cookies. See for example Wikipedia's <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Cookie_statement">cookie statement</a>.</p>  <h3 id="Do-Not-Track">Do-Not-Track</h3> <p>There are no legal or technological requirements for its use, but the <a title="The DNT (Do Not Track) request header indicates the user's tracking preference. It lets users indicate whether would prefer privacy rather than personalized content." href="headers/dnt"><code>DNT</code></a> header can be used to signal that a web application should disable either its tracking or cross-site user tracking of an individual user. See the <a title="The DNT (Do Not Track) request header indicates the user's tracking preference. It lets users indicate whether would prefer privacy rather than personalized content." href="headers/dnt"><code>DNT</code></a> header for more information.</p> <h3 id="EU_cookie_directive">EU cookie directive</h3> <p>Requirements for cookies across the EU are defined in <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32009L0136">Directive 2009/136/EC</a> of the European Parliament and came into effect on 25 May 2011. A directive is not a law by itself, but a requirement for EU member states to put laws in place that meet the requirements of the directive. The actual laws can differ from country to country.</p> <p>In short the EU directive means that before somebody can store or retrieve any information from a computer, mobile phone or other device, the user must give informed consent to do so. Many websites have added banners since then to inform the user about the use of cookies.</p> <p>For more, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#EU_cookie_directive">this Wikipedia section</a> and consult state laws for the latest and most accurate information.</p> <h3 id="Zombie_cookies_and_Evercookies">Zombie cookies and Evercookies</h3> <p>A more radical approach to cookies are zombie cookies or "Evercookies" which are recreated after their deletion and are intentionally hard to delete forever.
