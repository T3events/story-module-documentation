<h1>Overview</h1> <p class="summary"><strong>HTTP</strong> is a <a title="protocol: A protocol is a system of rules that define how data is exchanged within or between computers.  Communications between devices require that the devices agree on the format of the data that is being exchanged. The set of rules that defines a format is called a protocol." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/protocol" class="glossaryLink">protocol</a> which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13677/Fetching_a_page.png" alt="A Web document is the composition of different resources" style="height: 319px; width: 545px;"></p> <p>Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called <em>requests</em> and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called <em>responses</em>.</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13673/HTTP%20&amp;%20layers.png" alt="HTTP as an application layer protocol, on top of TCP (transport layer) and IP (network layer) and below the presentation layer." style="float: left; height: 299px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 20px; width: 418px;">Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time. It is an application layer protocol that is sent over <a title="TCP: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is an important network protocol that lets two hosts connect and exchange data streams.  TCP guarantees the delivery of data and packets in the same order as they were sent.  Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who were DARPA scientists at the time, designed TCP in the 1970s." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP" class="glossaryLink">TCP</a>, or over a <a title="TLS: Transport Layer Security (TLS), previously known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a protocol used by applications to communicate securely across a network, preventing tampering with and eavesdropping on email, web browsing, messaging, and other protocols." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS" class="glossaryLink">TLS</a>-encrypted TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used. Due to its extensibility, it is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.</p> <h2 id="Components_of_HTTP-based_systems">Components of HTTP-based systems</h2> <p>HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.</p> <p>Each individual request is sent to a server, which will handle it and provide an answer, called the <em>response</em>. Between this request and response there are numerous entities, collectively designated as <a title="The definition of that term (proxies) has not been written yet; please consider contributing it!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy" class="glossaryLink">proxies</a>, which perform different operations and act as gateways or <a title="The definition of that term (caches) has not been written yet; please consider contributing it!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cache" class="glossaryLink">caches</a>, for example.</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13679/Client-server-chain.png" alt="" style="height: 121px; width: 819px;"></p> <p>In reality, there are more computers between a browser and the server handling the request: there are routers, modems, and more. Thanks to the layered design of the Web, these are hidden in the network and transport layers. HTTP is on top at the application layer. Although important to diagnose network problems, the underlying layers are mostly irrelevant to the description of HTTP.</p> <h3 id="Client_the_user-agent">Client: the user-agent</h3> <p>The <em>user-agent</em> is any tool that acts on the behalf of the user. This role is primarily performed by the Web browser; a few exceptions being programs used by engineers, and Web developers to debug their applications.</p> <p>The browser is <strong>always</strong> the entity initiating the request. It is never the server (though some mechanisms have been added over the years to simulate server-initiated messages).</p> <p>To present a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document from the page. It then parses this file, fetching additional requests corresponding to execution scripts, layout information (CSS) to display, and sub-resources contained within the page (usually images and videos). The Web browser then mixes these resources to present to the user a complete document, the Web page. Scripts executed by the browser can fetch more resources in later phases and the browser updates the Web page accordingly.</p> <p>A Web page is a hypertext document. This means some parts of displayed text are links which can be activated (usually by a click of the mouse) to fetch a new Web page, allowing the user to direct their user-agent and navigate through the Web. The browser translates these directions in HTTP requests, and further interprets the HTTP responses to present the user with a clear response.</p> <h3 id="The_Web_server">The Web server</h3> <p>On the opposite side of the communication channel, is the server which <em>serves</em> the document as requested by the client. A server presents only as a single machine virtually: this is because it may actually be a collection of servers, sharing the load (load balancing) or a complex piece of software interrogating other computers (like cache, a DB server, e-commerce servers, …), totally or partially generating the document on demand.</p> <p>A server is not necessarily a single machine, but several servers can be hosted on the same machine. With HTTP/1.1 and the <a title="The Host request header specifies the domain name of the server (for virtual hosting), and (optionally) the TCP port number on which the server is listening." href="headers/host"><code>Host</code></a> header, they may even share the same IP address.</p> <h3 id="Proxies">Proxies</h3> <p>Between the Web browser and the server, numerous computers and machines relay the HTTP messages. Due to the layered structure of the Web stack, most of these operate at the transport, network or physical levels, becoming transparent at the HTTP layer, and could add significant impact on performance. Those operating at the application layers are generally called <strong>proxies</strong>. These can be transparent, or not (changing requests going through them or not), and may perform numerous functions:</p> <ul> <li>caching (the cache can be public or private, like the browser cache)</li> <li>filtering (like an antivirus scan, parental controls, …)</li> <li>load balancing (to allow multiple servers to serve the different requests)</li> <li>authentication (to control access to different resources)</li> <li>logging (allowing the storage of historical information)</li> </ul> <h2 id="Basic_aspects_of_HTTP">Basic aspects of HTTP</h2> <h3 id="HTTP_is_simple">HTTP is simple</h3> <p>Even with more complexity, introduced in HTTP/2 by encapsulating HTTP messages into frames, HTTP is generally designed to be simple and human readable. HTTP messages can be read and understood by humans, providing easier developer testing, and reduced complexity for new-comers.</p> <h3 id="HTTP_is_extensible">HTTP is extensible</h3> <p>Introduced in HTTP/1.0, <a href="headers">HTTP headers</a> made this protocol easy to extend and experiment with. New functionality can even be introduced, by a simple agreement between a client and a server about a new header's semantics.</p> <h3 id="HTTP_is_stateless_but_not_sessionless">HTTP is stateless, but not sessionless</h3> <p>HTTP is stateless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same connection, or not. This immediately becomes problematic when users wanted to interact with a page in a coherent way, for example with an e-commerce shopping basket. Using header extensibility, HTTP Cookies are added to the workflow, allowing session creation on each HTTP request to share the same context or the same state.</p> <p>While the core of HTTP itself is stateless, HTTP cookies allow the use of stateful sessions.</p> <h3 id="HTTP_and_connections">HTTP and connections</h3> <p>A connection is controlled at the transport layer, and therefore fundamentally out of scope for HTTP. Though HTTP doesn't require the underlying transport protocol to be connection-based; only requiring it to be <em>reliable</em>, or not loose messages (so at minimum presenting an error). Among the two most common transport protocols on the Internet, TCP is reliable and UDP isn't. HTTP subsequently relies on the TCP standard, which is connection-based, even though a connection is not always required.</p> <p>HTTP/1.0 opened a TCP connection for each request/response exchange, introducing two major flaws: opening a connection needs several round-trips of messages and therefore slow, but becomes more efficient when several messages are sent, and regularly sent: <em>warm</em> connections are more efficient than <em>cold</em> ones.</p> <p>In order to mitigate these flaws, HTTP/1.1 introduced pipelining (which proved difficult to implement) and persistent connections: the underlying TCP connection can be partially controlled using the <a title="The Connection general header controls whether or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes. If the value sent is keep-alive, the connection is persistent and not closed, allowing for subsequent requests to the same server to be done." href="headers/connection"><code>Connection</code></a> header. HTTP/2 went a step further by multiplexing messages over a single connection, helping keep the connection warm, and more efficient.</p> <p>Experiments are in progress to design a better transport protocol more suited to HTTP. For example, Google is experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> which builds on UDP to provide a more reliable and efficient transport protocol.</p> <h2 id="What_can_be_controlled_by_HTTP">What can be controlled by HTTP</h2> <p>This extensible nature of HTTP has, over time, allowed for more control and functionality of the Web. Cache or authentication methods were functions handled early in HTTP history. The ability to relax the <em>origin constraint</em>, by contrast, has only been added in the 2010s.</p> <p>Here is a list of common features controllable with HTTP.</p> <ul> <li>
<em>Cache</em><br> How documents are cached can be controlled by HTTP. The server can instruct proxies, and clients, what to cache and for how long. The client can instruct intermediate cache proxies to ignore the stored document.</li> <li>
<em>Relaxing the origin constraint</em><br> To prevent snooping and other privacy invasions, Web browsers enforce strict separation between Web sites. Only pages from the <strong>same origin</strong> can access all the information of a Web page. Though such constraint is a burden to the server, so HTTP headers can relax this strict separation server-side, allowing a document to become a patchwork of information sourced from different domains (there could even be security-related reasons to do so).</li> <li>
<em>Authentication</em><br> Some pages may be protected so only specific users can access it. Basic authentication may be provided by HTTP, either using the <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authenticate"><code>Authenticate</code></a> and similar headers, or by setting a specific session using HTTP cookies.</li> <li>
<em>Proxy and tunneling</em><br> Servers and/or clients are often located on intranets and hide their true IP address to others. HTTP requests then go through proxies to cross this network barrier. Not all proxies are HTTP proxies. The SOCKS protocol, for example, operates at a lower level. Others, like ftp, can be handled by these proxies.</li> <li>
<em>Sessions</em><br> Using HTTP cookies allows you to link requests with the state of the server. This creates sessions, despite basic HTTP being a state-less protocol. This is useful not only for e-commerce shopping baskets, but also for any site allowing user configuration of the output.</li> </ul> <h2 id="HTTP_flow">HTTP flow</h2> <p>When the client wants to communicate with a server, either being the final server or an intermediate proxy, it performs the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Open a TCP connection: The TCP connection will be used to send a request, or several, and receive an answer. The client may open a new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP connections to the servers.</li> <li>Send an HTTP message: HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are human-readable. With HTTP/2, these simple messages are encapsulated in frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the principle remains the same. <pre class="line-numbers  language-html">GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Accept-Language: fr</pre> </li> <li>Read the response sent by the server: <pre class="line-numbers  language-html">HTTP/1.1 200 OK

HTTP pipelining has proven difficult to implement in existing networks, where old pieces of software coexist with modern versions. HTTP pipelining has been superseded in HTTP/2 with more robust multiplexing requests within a frame.</p> <h2 id="HTTP_Messages">HTTP Messages</h2> <p>HTTP/1.1 and earlier HTTP messages are human-readable. In HTTP/2, these messages are embedded into a new binary structure, a frame, allowing optimizations like compression of headers and multiplexing. Even if only part of the original HTTP message is sent in this version of HTTP, the semantics of each message is unchanged and the client reconstitutes (virtually) the original HTTP/1.1 request. It is therefore useful to comprehend HTTP/2 messages in the HTTP/1.1 format.</p> <p>There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own format.</p> <h3 id="Requests">Requests</h3> <p>An example HTTP request:</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13687/HTTP_Request.png" alt="A basic HTTP request" style="height: 336px; width: 693px;"></p> <p>Requests consists of the following elements:</p> <ul> <li>An HTTP <a href="methods">method</a>, usually a verb like <a title="The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data." href="methods/get"><code>GET</code></a>, <a title="The HTTP POST method sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by the Content-Type header." href="methods/post"><code>POST</code></a> or a noun like <a title="The HTTP OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource. The client can specify a specific URL for the OPTIONS method, or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server." href="methods/options"><code>OPTIONS</code></a> or <a title="The HTTP HEAD method requests the headers that are returned if the specified resource would be requested with an HTTP GET method. Such a request can be done before deciding to download a large resource to save bandwidth, for example." href="methods/head"><code>HEAD</code></a> that defines the operation the client wants to perform. Typically, a client wants to fetch a resource (using <code>GET</code>) or post the value of an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms">HTML form</a> (using <code>POST</code>), though more operations may be needed in other cases.</li> <li>The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped from elements that are obvious from the context, for example without the <a title="protocol: A protocol is a system of rules that define how data is exchanged within or between computers.  Communications between devices require that the devices agree on the format of the data that is being exchanged.
