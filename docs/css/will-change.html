<h1>will-change</h1>  <p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>will-change</code></strong> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> property provides a way for authors to hint browsers about the kind of changes to be expected on an element, so that the browser can set up appropriate optimizations ahead of time before the element is actually changed.</span> These kind of optimizations can increase the responsiveness of a page by doing potentially expensive work ahead of time before they are actually required.</p> <p>Proper usage of this property can be a bit tricky:</p> <ul> <li> <p id="Don't_apply_will-change_to_too_many_elements"><em>Don't apply will-change to too many elements.</em> The browser already tries as hard as it can to optimize everything. Some of the stronger optimizations that are likely to be tied to <code>will-change</code> end up using a lot of a machine’s resources, and when overused like this can cause the page to slow down or consume a lot of resources.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Use sparingly.</em> The normal behavior for optimizations that the browser make is to remove the optimizations as soon as it can and revert back to normal. But adding <code>will-change</code> directly in a stylesheet implies that the targeted elements are always a few moments away from changing and the browser will keep the optimizations for much longer time than it would have otherwise. So it is a good practice to switch <code>will-change</code> on and off on using script code before and after the change occurs.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Don't apply will-change to elements to perform premature optimization</em>. If your page is performing well, don't add the <code>will-change</code> property to elements just to wring out a little more speed. <code>will-change</code> is intended to be used as something of a last resort, in order to try to deal with existing performance problems. It should not be used to anticipate performance problems. Excessive use of <code>will-change</code> will result in excessive memory use and will cause more complex rendering to occur as the browser attempts to prepare for the possible change. This will lead to worse performance.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Give_it_sufficient_time_to_work"><em>Give it sufficient time to work</em>. This property is intended as a method for authors to let the user-agent know about properties that are likely to change ahead of time. Then the browser can choose to apply any ahead-of-time optimizations required for the property change before the property change actually happens. So it is important to give the the browser some time to actually do the optimizations. Find some way to predict at least slightly ahead of time that something will change, and set <code>will-change</code> then.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Be aware, that will-change may actually influence the visual appearance of elements</em>, when used with property values, that create a <a href="css_positioning/understanding_z_index/the_stacking_context">stacking context</a> (e.g. will-change: opacity), as the stacking context is created up front.</p> </li> </ul> <table class="properties"><tbody>

</pre> <p>The above example adds the <code>will-change</code> property directly to the stylesheet, which will cause the browser to keep the optimization in memory for much longer than it is needed and we've already seen why that should be avoided. Below is another example showing how to apply the <code>will-change</code> property through scripting, which is probably what you should be doing in most cases.</p> <pre data-language="js">var el = document.getElementById('element');

// Set will-change when the element is hovered
el.addEventListener('mouseenter', hintBrowser);
el.addEventListener('animationEnd', removeHint);

function hintBrowser() {
  // The optimizable properties that are going to change
  // in the animation's keyframes block
  this.style.willChange = 'transform, opacity';
}

function removeHint() {
  this.style.willChange = 'auto';
}</pre> <p>It may however be appropriate to include <code>will-change</code> in your style sheet for an application that does page flips on key presses like an album or a slide deck presentation where the pages are large and complex. This will let browser prepare the transition ahead of time and allow for snappy transitions between the pages as soon as the key is pressed.</p> <pre data-language="css">.slide {
