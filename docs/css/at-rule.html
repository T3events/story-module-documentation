<h1>At-rule</h1> <p><span class="seoSummary">An <strong>at-rule</strong> is a <a href="syntax#CSS_statements">CSS statement</a> beginning with an at sign, '<code>@</code>' (<code>U+0040 COMMERCIAL AT</code>), followed by an identifier and includes everything up to the next semi-colon, '<code>;</code>' (<code>U+003B SEMICOLON</code>), or the next <a href="syntax#CSS_declarations_blocks">CSS block</a>, whichever comes first.</span></p> <p>There are several at-rules, designated by their identifiers, each with a different syntax:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="@charset" title="The @charset CSS at-rule specifies the character encoding used in the style sheet. It must be the first element in the style sheet and not be preceded by any character; as it is not a nested statement, it cannot be used inside conditional group at-rules. If several @charset at-rules are defined, only the first one is used, and it cannot be used inside a style attribute on an HTML element or inside the &lt;style&gt; element where the character set of the HTML page is relevant."><code>@charset</code></a> — Defines the character set used by the style sheet.</li> <li>
<a href="@import" title="The @import CSS at-rule is used to import style rules from other style sheets. These rules must precede all other types of rules, except @charset rules; as it is not a nested statement, @import cannot be used inside conditional group at-rules."><code>@import</code></a> — Tells the CSS engine to include an external style sheet.</li> <li>
<a href="@namespace" title="@namespace is an at-rule that defines XML namespaces to be used in a CSS style sheet. The defined namespaces can be used to restrict the universal, type, and attribute selectors to only select elements within that namespace. The @namespace rule is generally only useful when dealing with documents containing multiple namespaces—such as HTML5 with inline SVG or MathML, or XML that mixes multiple vocabularies."><code>@namespace</code></a> — Tells the CSS engine that all its content must be considered prefixed with an XML namespace.</li> <li>
<strong><em>Nested at-rules</em></strong> — A subset of nested statements, which can be used as a statement of a style sheet as well as inside of conditional group rules: <ul> <li>
<a href="@media" title="The @media CSS at-rule associates a set of nested statements, in a CSS block that is delimited by curly braces, with a condition defined by a media query. The @media at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule."><code>@media</code></a> — A conditional group rule which will apply its content if the device meets the criteria of the condition defined using a <em>media query</em>.</li> <li>
<a href="@supports" title="The @supports CSS at-rule associates a set of nested statements, in a CSS block, that is delimited by curly braces, with a condition consisting of testing of CSS declarations, that is property-value pairs, combined with arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations of them. Such a condition is called a supports condition."><code>@supports</code></a>  — A conditional group rule which will apply its content if the browser meets the criteria of the given condition.</li> <li>
<a href="@document" title="The @document CSS at-rule restricts the style rules contained within it based on the URL of the document. It is designed primarily for user style sheets. A @document rule can specify one or more matching functions. If any of the functions apply to a URL, the rule will take effect on that URL."><code>@document</code></a>  — A conditional group rule which will apply its content if the document in which the style sheet is applied meets the criteria of the given condition. <em>(deferred to Level 4 of CSS Spec)</em>
</li> <li>
<a href="@page" title="The @page CSS at-rule is used to modify some CSS properties when printing a document. You can't change all CSS properties with @page. You can only change the margins, orphans, widows, and page breaks of the document. Attempts to change any other CSS properties will be ignored."><code>@page</code></a> — Describes the aspect of layout changes which will be applied when printing the document.</li> <li>
<a href="@font-face" title="The @font-face CSS at-rule allows authors to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers. The @font-face at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule."><code>@font-face</code></a> — Describes the aspect of an external font to be downloaded.</li> <li>
<a href="@keyframes" title="The @keyframes CSS at-rule lets authors control the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by establishing keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence that must be reached by certain points during the animation. This gives you more specific control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence than you'd get when letting the browser handle everything automatically."><code>@keyframes</code></a>  — Describes the aspect of intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence.</li> <li>
<a href="@viewport" title="The @viewport CSS at-rule contains a set of nested descriptors in a CSS block that is delimited by curly braces. These descriptors control viewport settings, primarily on mobile devices."><code>@viewport</code></a>  — Describes the aspects of the viewport for small screen devices. <em>(currently at the Working Draft stage)</em>
</li> <li>
<a href="@counter-style" title="The @counter-style CSS at-rule lets authors define specific counter styles that are not part of the predefined set of styles. A @counter-style rule defines how to convert a counter value into a string representation."><code>@counter-style</code></a> — Defines specific counter styles that are not part of the predefined set of styles. <em>(at the Candidate Recommendation stage, but only implemented in Gecko as of writing)</em>
</li> <li>
<a href="@font-feature-values" title="The @font-feature-values CSS at-rule allows authors to use a common name in font-variant-alternates for feature activated differently in OpenType. It allows to simplify the CSS when using several fonts."><code>@font-feature-values</code></a> (plus <code>@swash</code>, <code>@ornaments</code>, <code>@annotation</code>, <code>@stylistic</code>, <code>@styleset</code> and <code>@character-variant</code>)<br> — Define common names in <a href="font-variant-alternates" title="The font-variant-alternates CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs. These alternate glyphs may be referenced by alternative names defined in @font-feature-values."><code>font-variant-alternates</code></a> for feature activated differently in OpenType. <em>(at the Candidate Recommendation stage, but only implemented in Gekko as of writing)</em>
</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="Conditional_Group_Rules">Conditional Group Rules</h2> <p>Much like the values of properties, each at-rule has a different syntax. Nevertheless, several of them can be grouped into a special category named <strong>conditional group rules</strong>. These statements share a common syntax and each of them can include <em>nested statements</em>—either <em>rulesets</em> or <em>nested at-rules</em>. Furthermore, they all convey a common semantic meaning—they all link some type of condition, which at any time evaluates to either <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. If the condition evaluates to <strong>true</strong>, then all of the statements within the group will be applied.</p> <p>Conditional group rules are defined in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-conditional/">CSS Conditionals Level 3</a> and are:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="@media" title="The @media CSS at-rule associates a set of nested statements, in a CSS block that is delimited by curly braces, with a condition defined by a media query. The @media at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule."><code>@media</code></a>,</li> <li>
<a href="@supports" title="The @supports CSS at-rule associates a set of nested statements, in a CSS block, that is delimited by curly braces, with a condition consisting of testing of CSS declarations, that is property-value pairs, combined with arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations of them. Such a condition is called a supports condition."><code>@supports</code></a>,</li> <li>
<a href="@document" title="The @document CSS at-rule restricts the style rules contained within it based on the URL of the document. It is designed primarily for user style sheets. A @document rule can specify one or more matching functions. If any of the functions apply to a URL, the rule will take effect on that URL."><code>@document</code></a>. <em>(deferred to Level 4 of CSS Spec) </em>
</li> </ul> <p>Since each conditional group may also contain nested statements, there may be an unspecified amount of nesting.</p> <h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2> <table class="standard-table"> <tbody> <tr> <th scope="col">Specification</th> <th scope="col">Status</th> <th scope="col">Comment</th> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-3/" class="external" lang="en" title="The 'CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3' specification" hreflang="en">CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3</a></td> <td><span class="spec-CR">Candidate Recommendation</span></td> <td>Initial definition</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://compat.spec.whatwg.org#css-at-rules" class="external" lang="en" hreflang="en">Web Compatibility Standard<br><small lang="en-US">The definition of 'CSS At-rules' in that specification.</small></a></td> <td><span class="spec-Living">Living Standard</span></td> <td>Standardizes <code>@-webkit-keyframes</code>.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="See_also">See also</h2> <ul> <li><a href="index">CSS Reference</a></li> <li>CSS Key Concepts: <a href="syntax" title="Syntax">CSS syntax</a>, <a href="at-rule" title="At-rule">at-rule</a>, <a href="comments" title="Comments">comments</a>, <a href="specificity" title="Specificity">specificity</a> and <a href="inheritance" title="inheritance">inheritance</a>, the <a href="css_box_model/introduction_to_the_css_box_model" title="Box model">box</a>, <a href="layout_mode" title="CSS layout modes">layout modes</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Visual_formatting_model" title="Visual formatting model">visual formatting models</a>, and <a href="css_box_model/mastering_margin_collapsing" title="Margin collapsing">margin collapsing</a>, or the <a href="initial_value" title="initial value">initial</a>, <a href="computed_value" title="computed value">computed</a>, <a href="resolved_value" title="resolved value">resolved</a>, <a href="specified_value" title="specified value">specified</a>, <a href="used_value" title="used value">used</a>, and <a href="actual_value" title="actual value">actual</a> values.
