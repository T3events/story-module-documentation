<h1>:focus-within</h1>  <p>The <strong><code>:focus-within</code></strong> CSS <a href="pseudo-classes">pseudo-class</a> applies to all elements, for which the <a title="The :focus CSS pseudo-class is applied when an element has received focus, either from the user selecting it with the use of a keyboard or by activating with the mouse (e.g. a form input)." href=":focus"><code>:focus</code></a> pseudo-class applies and additionally to all shadow-including descendants. That is, it is applied when an element has received focus, either from the user selecting it using a keyboard or by activating with the mouse (e.g. a form input).</p> <p>Shadow-including descendant means that the element is either the decendant of another element or the element's root element is a <a title="The definition of that term (shadow root) has not been written yet; please consider contributing it!" class="glossaryLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shadow_DOM">shadow root</a>.</p> <p>This pseudo class applies only to the focused element, not its parents, like <a title='The :checked CSS pseudo-class selector represents any radio (&lt;input type="radio"&gt;), checkbox (&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;) or option (&lt;option&gt; in a &lt;select&gt;) element that is checked or toggled to an on state. The user can change this state by clicking on the element, or selecting a different value, in which case the :checked pseudo-class no longer applies to this element, but will to the relevant one.' href=":checked"><code>:checked</code></a> and <a title="The :enabled CSS pseudo-class represents any enabled element. An element is enabled if it can be activated (e.g. selected, clicked on or accept text input) or accept focus. The element also has an disabled state, in which it can't be activated or accept focus." href=":enabled"><code>:enabled</code></a> but unlike <a title="The :active CSS pseudo-class matches when an element is being activated by the user. It allows the page to give a feedback that the activation has been detected by the browser. When interacting with a mouse, this is typically the time between the user presses the mouse button and releases it. The :active pseudo-class is also typically matched when using the keyboard tab key. It is frequently used on &lt;a&gt; and &lt;button&gt; HTML elements, but may not be limited to just those." href=":active"><code>:active</code></a> or <a title="The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :visited, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :hover rule after the :link and :visited rules but before the :active one, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active." href=":hover"><code>:hover</code></a>.</p> <h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2> <pre class="syntaxbox">:focus-within { <var>style properties</var> }</pre> <h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2> <pre data-language="css">.first-name:focus-within {
