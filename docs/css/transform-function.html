<h1>transform-function()</h1> <p>The <code>&lt;transform-function&gt;</code> CSS data type denotes a function applied to an element's representation in order to modify it. Usually such transform may be expressed by matrices and the resulting images can be determined using matrix multiplication on each point.</p> <h2 id="Coordinates_for_2D_graphics">Coordinates for 2D graphics</h2> <p>There are several coordinate models used when describing transformation. The most common are the Cartesian coordinate system and homogeneous coordinates.</p> <h3 id="Cartesian_coordinates">Cartesian coordinates</h3> <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/5796/=coord_in_R2.png"><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/files/3438/coord_in_R2.png" style="float: right; width: 171px;;float: none; display: block;"></a></p> <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system" class="external">Cartesian coordinates</a> each point of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry" class="external">Euclidian space</a> is described using two values, the abscissa and the ordinate. The origin, the <code>(0, 0)</code> is the top-left corner of the element. Unlike the usual geometric convention, and like most cases in computer graphics, the y-axis goes to the bottom. Each point is mathematically described using the vector notation <code>(x,y)</code>.</p> <p>Each linear function is described using a 2x2 matrix like:</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <p><math> <mfenced> <mtable> <mtr><mtd>a</mtd><mtd>c</mtd></mtr> <mtr><mtd>b</mtd><mtd>d</mtd></mtr> </mtable> </mfenced> </math></p> </div> <p>Applying the transformation consists in doing, for each point, the matrix multiplication between both:</p> <div style="text-align: center;">

In fact all transformations that are linear functions can be described. One major transformation is not linear and therefore must be special-cased when using this notation: translation. The translation vector (tx, ty) must be expressed separately, as two more parameters.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Ferdinand_M%C3%B6bius" class="external">Möbius</a>' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates" class="external">homogeneous coordinates</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry" class="external">projective geometry</a> leading to 3x3 transformation matrices, though more complex and unusual for non-specialists, doesn't suffer from the translation limitation as these can be expressed as linear functions in this algebra, removing the need for special cases.</p> <h2 id="Functions_defining_transformations">Functions defining transformations</h2> <p>Several functions are available to describe transformations in CSS.
